The FSCDC is dedicated to Scottish Country Dance. We are part of the Frankfurter Tanzkreis (within the Jugendring Frankfurt ) and are affiliated to the Royal Scottish Country Dance Society . The Club has been around for over 50 years and is among the oldest Scottish dance groups in Germany. The dancers meet on Tuesdays for class and organize the annual Frankfurt Spring Ball and other events for Scottish Country dancers and those interested.
