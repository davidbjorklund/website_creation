His expressive style is the result of a lifetime of study and the relentless pursuit of music mastery. His passion and intensity are a blend of his mother's Greek ancestry and his father's soulful black heritage. "Nowadays most young blues players are Strat-wielding Stevie Ray Vaughan-a-bes. Not Chris Cain. With a voice that recalls B.B. King and a thick toned Gibson guitar sound reminiscent of Albert King, Cain is forging a unique style. With his own highly personalized songwriting, "Hall Of Shame" is a giant step in the development of one of the most compelling young bluesmen on today's scene." -Larry Nager (syndicated Scripts-Howard music critic) Cain News https://vimeo.com/308031380?fbclid=IwAR2-DmCXrPNL5gnZl9tTXMZi1GdG4LPxqWpnAOQY7LdHPxK3FOq2pLgK9k0 Video Review Paradise - Plugged In and Turned on  Jan 2019 KCAT TV 15 Jazz Tonight Featuring Chris Cain - Interview  Oct 15, 2018 talkinblues Talkinâ Blues podcast episode 115 - Chris Cain A conversation with blues and jazz multi-instrumentalist, Chris Cain  Jun 28th, 2018 Soul Bag Magazine â France Chris Cain interview  Mar 17, 2018 Blues Blast Magazine Chris Cain â Self Titled | Album Review  Oct 8, 2017 Times-Herald Arts & Community Cain is Able -- Posted by John Sollenberger  Apr 27, 2017 Times-Herald Arts & Community A&E SOURCE: Chris Cain has an axe to grind at the Empress  Feb 15, 2017 2019 International Tour Dates View All Dates Argentina February 1 thru 10 Madrid, Spain March 29 thru April 16 France and Italy Tour w/ Luca Giordano March 27 - April 15 Australia May 5 thru May 20 New Zealand w/ Rodger Fox May 28 thru June 5 Georgia, Eastern Europe July 18 to 22, 2019 Western Europe Sept 8 to 21, 2019 Georgia, Eastern Europe Sept 22 to Oct 14, 2019 Denmark Oct 31 to Nov 1, 2019 ======================================================== FOOTER ========================================================= Home About History The Band Gallery Video Discography Tour Contact Buy  Â© Follow Cain <li><a class="fa fa-twitter" href="#"></a></li> <li><a class="fa fa-google-plus" href="#"></a></li> <li><a class="fa fa-instagram" href="#"></a></li> BOOKING INFORMATION Suzy Tyler (408) 396-2922 suzytyler22@gmail.com Web Design by d2m interactive Photos by BG Phillips Photography
