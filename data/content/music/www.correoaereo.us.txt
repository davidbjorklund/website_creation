There's a huge difference between good performers and just good musicians.

Performing traditional music of Venezuela, Argentina & Mexico, Correo Aereo combines a stunning array of string and percussive instruments with silken vocal harmonies described as “…locked in embrace.” by the Austin Chronicle . “Correo Aereo is deeply respectful of the traditions they present yet they are not afraid to explore new directions that expand the parameters of their art form. [They] offer superb performance. They are true professionals with exacting standards. They will only put on stage work that they have honed to perfection. Above all, I love to be in their presence when they perform. At times to watch their vivid presence on-stage, at others to listen, with my eyes closed, to the beauty of their sounds.” Spider Kedelsky, Producer/Curator, Town Hall Seattle, Global Rhythms Series Read more about the band end .footer-widget Semillas De Inmensidad previous play pause next playlist Upcoming Concerts C&P Coffee Date: Jul 28, 2019 Private Event Date: Aug 3, 2019 The Tasting Room Date: Aug 9, 2019 C&P Coffee Date: Aug 11, 2019 Perihelion Brewery Date: Aug 13, 2019 Kruckeberg Botanical Garden Date: Aug 14, 2019 Concert In The Parks: Edmonds City Park Date: Aug 18, 2019 Ott & Hunter Wines!
