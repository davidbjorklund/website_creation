There is no factory or production line where instruments are mass produced in a short period of time. MADE TO WITHSTAND AUSTRALIAN CONDITIONS Australia has a very harsh climate with extremes of heat and humidity and everything in between. My instruments have been reinforced to withstand what the Australian climate can give them using modern high tech adhesives and finishes as well as extra reinforcement in common problem areas such as necks and soundboards. AFTER SALES SERVICE If you need anything I am just around the corner. There is no need to worry about about shipping instruments overseas with risk of damages & loss  as well as high freight charges and import duties. DO YOU WANT TO KNOW MORE?

All Right Reserved My name is George Stasinopoulos and I have been playing the Greek bouzouki for over thirty five years. I am based in Adelaide, Australia  and build instruments only of the highest quality with attention to detail. As a bouzouki player and an experienced luthier, I understand the needs of the individual client and work closely with them to give the best possible outcome for the instrument they desire.  The building process does take considerable time as each instrument is meticulously hand crafted to order.  My aim is to produce high quality bouzoukis with optimum acoustic performance with ease of playability, whilst maintaining a high degree of structural integrity for longevity of the instrument.  Instruments are individually handmade to order only, and I can offer a range of options to suit your individual requirements. I also import a range of economically priced instruments and carry a range of bouzouki accessories & parts.  Check out the Gallery to see some of the instruments I have made and an example of the high standard of workmanship I aim to produce. *NOW AVAILABLE - A RANGE OF BOUZOUKI ACCESSORIES AND IMPORTED INSTRUMENTS.
