Mabry, to grace us with some of his wonderful original songs as an opener.  It's been our pleasure to play this show at the Buchanan Theatre for over 20 years!  Without the support and love of our family, friends, fans and the beautiful folks of Buchanan, this would not be possible.  "There's no reason to write songs without someone to hear them".  It should be a fun night of acoustic entertainment and some surprises for sure.  Until the next song,  Acoustic Endeavors  Warren, Kelly, Greg, Dewey, Tommy & Billy  Buchanan Theatre  19778 Main St.  Buchanan, VA 24066  Buchanan Theatre 02/23/2017 Leave a comment Share Celebrate the holiday weekend with us!   Acoustic Endeavors  Sat, Jul 2 @ 7:00 PM — 10:00 PM  Hickory Hill Vineyards, 1722 Hickory Cove Lane, Moneta, VA  Acoustic Endeavors, North American "Stress Free Summer Tour 2016", embarks and concludes at Hickory Hills Vinyards on 7/2/16 from 7-10 p.m. Come help us celebrate a successful tour at a beautiful location (family friendly), tasty beverages, classy people and an enjoyable evening of acoustic music.

If you've come before, I'd like to invite you again.  If you've never been, please do.  This letter would not be complete without saying the biggest THANK YOU to our dear friend, Emily Prillaman (who throws the greatest post-party in the world)!  BIG LOVE SISTER!  Join us for our annual show at the historic Buchanan Theatre this Saturday.  Doors open at 7 pm and the show starts at 7:30 pm.  You don't want to miss this show!  Advance tickets are available by calling 540-254-1212.  Hope to see all of you there...  Buchanan Theatre  19778 Main Street, Buchanan, VA  24066  Until the next song,  Acoustic Endeavors  Warren 02/24/2016 Leave a comment Share Happy Holidays!   We want to wish everyone a happy, healthy and safe holiday season!  We hope that all of you will be able to spend time with the people you love...See you all soon!
