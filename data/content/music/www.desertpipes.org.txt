Chapter activities include monthly meetings and rehearsals. We sponsor workshops given by leading recorder teachers and performers (see our photos page for just a few examples). Part of our mission is to promote recorder playing among students. The possibilities include classroom performance, helping with resources and the opportunity to attend our meetings. For any teachers in the Phoenix area, please contact info@desertpipes.org and let us know what might be useful to you and how we can help. Our repertoire for monthly playing sessions includes a variety of styles, eras, and arrangements starting at an intermediate level, but we have resources for players of all levels of ability. Membership fee, per calendar year, is $60 for members of the American Recorder Society and $70 for others, or $8 per meeting for part-year residents or drop-ins. There is no charge for your first meeting, so come try us out. Many of our members have their own performing groups, so it is a great opportunity for networking with fellow musicians.
