Barbara Lewis performs powerful folk and pop songs that are both entertaining and highly emotional. With her wide-range, classically-trained voice, vulnerable stage presence and elegant storytelling ability, she is known as  “a hugely gifted singer, a born communicator.” Lewis creates concerts the are based on a theme. Recent concerts have been,  Passionate Heart -A celebration of Joni Mitchell and Leonard Cohen and  My Canada -Singing the Soul of a Country. Lewis’s current show is “ Blood Orchid -How Women Feel”. (View a  short promo video .) Until 2013, Barbara had remained devoted to the composing and performing of her own material exclusively. Of these works, videos for “Lullaby for a Deep Sleep” and “Body” have aired extensively on PBS. With the show, Passionate Heart, Barbara began to include covers in her concerts. Lewis has performed with Juno-winning musicians and principle instrumentalists from the Montreal Symphony Orchestra. She has recorded several CDs. Many of her song compositions are for sale on digital platforms. Her current pianist/arranger is the well-known, Toronto-based, Doug Balfour. Barbara loves salsa dancing, cats and the Spanish language. She  splits her time between stylish, indie-music-crazy Montreal (where it snows a lot!) and sunny, glorious Mexico (where it rains a little). Barbara is also a vocal coach.
