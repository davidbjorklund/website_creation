There are many reasons I no longer make guitars, it's a tough business with many ups and downs but I am happy I did things my way and my guitars have reached many people all over the world. I want to thank all the people and artists that have supported ES GUITARS over the years. I did not want to take the web site down so I created more of a visual web site with old pictures and never before seen pictures. I hope you support me in my new venture SENTAN . For now I am not making guitars but I still have a vision and desire to continue. I still have many designs that never saw the light of day. Who knows, I may be back, stay tuned, to be continued.

We wanted to create new designs without compromising sound and quality. We wanted our guitars to stand out not only in looks but sound and features. ES Guitars wanted to provide the musicians of tomorrow unique guitars. Rather than making another corporate guitar look alike. ES Guitars is modernizing the look of guitars without compromising sound, quality and playability. Our love for music has inspired us to transform wood into works of art. As a guitarist your music comes first. We wanted to offer you something different and original just like the music you play. We strived to be different and move away from the "cookie-cutter" mentality of corporate guitars. It's your music, your guitar, DARE TO BE DIFFERENT. Our Guitar Philosophy (Manifesto) ES Guitars is trying to push the envelope of guitar designs. Over the years companies have turned out the same product year after year;same guitar different paint color. Electric guitars consist of the same parts from when it was first created back in the 1940s. Any product that has been around a while has modernized in looks. Although, modern guitars have some degree of innovation the basic shape of the guitar has not changed. Think of cars, cell phones, computers, etc. they all have modern looks although the basic operation is the same. At the moment the guitar industry has failed to update its guitar designs for several reasons: Lack of interest on the part of musicians. Lack of demand. Small market share for these designs (mostly Heavy Metal market) Lack of creativity. If the guitar sells why change it. Believe it or not, musicians are very resistant to change. Many people grew up on certain guitars and continue to play these guitars as adults. The fact that their guitar role models or idols never played a funky looking guitar turns people off from playing eccentric designs. Musicians need to change the perception of music instruments. A music instrument is a form of expression just like the music that it creates. ES Guitars offers guitarists an alternative. We offer radical new designs yet we do not compromise the sound, functionality, playability or quality of electric guitars. ES Guitars inspires the spirit of rebellion that fueled Rock and Roll with new and innovative guitar designs. Music has changed over the years and so should electric guitar designs. People have been conditioned by years of stagnant designs. Electric guitar models do not change from year to year. Why do musicians accept this? ES Guitars want to defy the conventional electric guitar designs regardless of market share and social stigmas. ES Guitars makes guitars out of love for music. Let's face it, making guitars is a tough business and making original nonconforming models is more difficult. ES Guitars is not a corporate machine looking out to turn out a profit. ES Guitars proudly makes bold, innovative, and original in your face guitar designs. No other company would dare make this type of guitar for the fear of being labeled a HEAVY METAL GUITAR. This kills the profits. ES Guitars is committed to all forms of music, but we are a METAL company and always will be. We will return!
