To thrill the women who aren't excited with the woman's naked bootie, Northey has included a 1983 photo of himself as a young stud (ha!) singing with Jimmy Buffett (true!). Northey now says his 15 minutes of fame on stage with Buffett can't compare to the daily life of song that is his real dream come true. Â  Â  Â Congratulations to producer Dean Otto and engineer Al Phillips - it's as if professional movers relocated Mark Northey to the Taj Mahal. The studio musicians in the King Kong Band bring a professional sound that is far superior to Northey's musicians in earlier CDs. A variety of wind instruments, from flutes to trombones, add a colorful touch to many songs on the latest CD. Excellent sounds from violins, steel drums, lap steel guitar and accordion fill the songs with top-notch music. Â  Â  Â Without a doubt, the title cutÂ  Wine and Women in Thongs Â takes the cake as the most popular song on the CD. Northey is at his best with his tongue-in-cheek (again, no pun intended) lyrics: Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  My sixth-grade nun said, "Listen son, you'll probably beÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a sex fiend some day. Just a bum on the beach, drinkingÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Love Potion No. 9 and wasting away." Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  But I said, "God made gluteus maximus, sister, so youÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â know that can't be wrong. "And these are a few of myÂ  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â favorite things: wine and women in thongs." Â  Â  Â Mark follows this sunned buns song with a squeaky clean tribute to his mom, called "My Mother's Prayers." Mark had first included the religious song on a cassette of his tunes made years ago for his mom, but she rarely listened to it. Why? Well preceding "My Mother's Prayers" was a song about genital herpes and other STDs. Mom almost always turned off the cassette player before making it to the ballad written about her.Â  Â  Â  Â If Mark's mom were alive today, she might say, "Son, son, how long do I have to pray before you put out my song as a single? How long must I wait before I can listen to it! Please, don't sneak it on a B side, either." Â  Â  Â The CD lyrics booklet shows noteworthy innovation. Northey's creative wife Denise provides a descriptive photograph to match each of the dozen songs. Rather than print lyrics, Mark explains the origin of each tune. He reveals what drives him to lead the off-the-wall life he does, "I'll never be rich or handsome, but I will never be boring." Â  Â  Â Indeed! Northey has us laughing about ordinary life in his song "Murphy's Law," with lyrics that include, "When the gorgeous blonde pulls up next to you, your finger's up your nose." (C'mon guys, it's true.) Or how about, "When you think you've found the perfect catch, you find out she's got kids."Â  Â  Â  Â His life is about laughing his way to the top, while also enjoying the behind. Â  Music expert Charlie "Tall Man" Skaer wrote the above article. Â  </hs:element47> <hs:element48> Â  Â  Â The CDÂ  Wine & Women in Thongs Â has Mark Northey written all over it even on the beautiful bare butt he's autographing in a full-color photo inside the recording.Â  Â  Â  Â The photo brings to mind the lyrics from that once-famous Dire Straits song: "Ah, that ain't workin', that's the way you do it, money for nothing and the chicks for free." Â  Â  Â If only it were that easy. Northey has worked his butt off (no pun intended) to write, record and promote his third CD that sounds and looksÂ  </hs:element48> <hs:element81> </hs:element81> <hs:element37> Who Is Mark Northey?
