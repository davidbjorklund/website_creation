Stephan Connor, Luthier "My Connor brings great volume and range of orchestral coloration that I only feel when conducting orchestras. There are sweet spots all over the guitar and the notes above the twelfth fret on my Connor, especially the trebles, are clearer and louder than on any guitar I have ever played."
