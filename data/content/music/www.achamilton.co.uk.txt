Getting new customers and keeping existing customers are equally important to us. As the internet has changed all our lives we continue to grow from strength to strength applying the tried and trusted methods of traditional retail sales to this new world of internet sales and store sales. The world is a smaller place but we are all still individuals within it.

Our closest town is Blackpool and nearby is Lytham St Annes. Blackburn and Southport are close by. Lancaster, Morecambe, Wigan, Burnley, Ormskirk, Bolton, Leigh, Accrington are also near me.
