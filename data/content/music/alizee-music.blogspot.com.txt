Adidas Yeezy is a collaboration between German sportswear brand Adidas and American rapper Kanye West . Kanye in his Yeezy Zebra's Kanye West giving away some Yeezy's Oh wait... that was SNL :) Kanye West made a surprise appearance at Coachella Saturday April 20, 2019, and of course he did it in Yeezy's. Plus... doing the Easter Sunday 9 AM Service along with a merch tent selling clothing where you could buy a dip dyed shirt that reads "Holy Spirit" for $225 Meanwhile back at Sneaker Island It looks like TWO more pairs of Yeezy's  It might be two pair of Yeezy Moonrocks, maybe. or Turtle Doves No Worries...The price of Yeezy's are becoming more affordable. Scarcity drove the market in the past. Now Adidas is increasing production bringing prices down. Plus there is the politics of Kanye West and who knows what that means to business?
