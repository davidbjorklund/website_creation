Great ceilidhs from the Auld Reekie Ceilidh Band With fiddles, piano, acoustic guitar, mandolin and dance caller, the Auld Reekie Ceilidh Band has been playing great ceilidhs around the Edinburgh area for the last 20 years. We are an experienced, professional band and over the years have played weddings at Edinburgh Castle, Stirling Castle, House for an Art Lover in Glasgow, Dynamic Earth, the Hub and most of the other castles and hotels around Edinburgh. We’ve also played at prestigious balls in the Royal Museum of Scotland, the Assembly Rooms, at the Festival of the Sea in Leith and at lots of fundraising ceilidhs and birthday parties. We've also played ceilidhs in Holland and Italy! In fact we’ve played at just about every scale and type of event you could imagine! Our promise to you is that we will make every effort to make your ceildih fun and inclusive by playing a wide range of dances to suit all energy levels and dancing abilities. We will also provide as much dance calling as your guests need so even the most reluctant dancer will be comfortable and ready to take the floor!   Talk to us about what you need, we'll be happy to give you a quote.
