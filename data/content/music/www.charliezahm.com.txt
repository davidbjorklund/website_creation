Sing Me a Song of a Lad that Is Gone My first Celtic studio CD in 6 years, filled with great songs old and new---some requested, some chosen by me as little-known gems. I think this is the best to date, the musicians are fantastic---I hope you have a listen to the clips! What do you think? Angels Heard on High Enjoy my newest CD—my second collection of the joyous music of Christmas! I greatly enjoyed working with some of the best in the music business to bring this collection of songs celebrating the Season and the birth of the baby Jesus, come to save this weary world. I love these songs, and I hope you enjoy them too! Far Away and Across the Sea CD Live recording of many of the songs you have been asking me to record for years and more. A personal concert in your living room or car. Visit The Music Shop for all my CDs/DVDs! "The reason I was asked over (to perform for US troops at Al Udeid Airbase in Qatar) in the first place is because of the message of 'Prayer for a Solder' and many of the other songs I have written — my appreciation for the men and women of our military (and) their families back home." — Charlie Zahm, (Chester County Press, June 4, 2014) — CLICK HERE FOR WHOLE ARTICLE "You are an exceptionally gifted artist and your voice rings true." — Bob Shane, founding member of the Kingston Trio and a vocal hero of Charlie's "The amazing thing is, the Fosters have hosted Charlie Zahm and no one else at their concerts."

(Chester County Press, May 5, 2010 — CLICK HERE FOR WHOLE ARTICLE ) "Charlie represents an excellence in music that far transcends most of what you hear on the radio these days," says Ken Carpenter, a Nashville filmmaker/producer ("Philadelphia Inquirer" May 3, 2008 — CLICK HERE FOR WHOLE ARTICLE )   "The concert was fantastic and the audience was captivated. The Pavilion was packed to the gills and everyone seemed to know and have a personal connection to your music." – Performing Arts Coordinator, Longwood Gardens   "Charlie Zahm is a big man with a powerful and expressive singing voice. Listening to him sing Scottish and Irish music is like a deep draught of a thick, heady stout, rich in taste and body. His latest recording, "Among the Heather", is more like a luxurious dram of Irish cream -- smooth and sweet, yet intoxicating all the same." – Tom Knapp, Publisher, Rambles.net Contact Information Charlie Zahm Charlie Zahm 1026 Olive Street Coatesville, PA 19320 (610) 806-3493 Email: maritimes@aol.com ~ Email greatly preferred ~ Join Charlie on   Home | About | Music Shop | Order | Press | Schedule Copyright © 2019 Charlie Zahm.
