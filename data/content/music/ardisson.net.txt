Network (Budapest, 2016) As Ardisson  I have recorded experimental dance music , acid , and somewhat more bizarre soundscapes since 1997 – including several 12″s on Seed Records .  I’ve also worked extensively with members of Southbank Gamelan Players on the Augmented Gamelan project, experimenting with modified acoustic instruments in networks of sound and light. This was the subject of my recent  AHRC funded PhD research at Middlesex University . Other recent collaborative works include making sound pieces out of hand-held vibrating torches , analysis of brainwaves under the influence of LSD , and the movement of  single-celled freshwater creatures .
