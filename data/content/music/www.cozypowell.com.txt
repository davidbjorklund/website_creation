As originally conceived, this website was something that Cozy wanted to use to promote himself and his music, but he unfortunately died roughly four months after it opened. What is here is a combination of Cozy’s original content ideas with some updated graphics as well as the many tributes that have come his way since his untimely passing. Cozy Powell may be gone, but his music lives on, in more ways than one. end .service Links Here are some links that meant something to Cozy.  These are mostly the same links he chose in 1997.
