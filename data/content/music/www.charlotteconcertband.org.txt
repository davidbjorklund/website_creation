This program allows us to recognize those generous members of our community who provide the financial support on which our organization so crucially relies. We hope that by recognizing our patrons in this manner, we will encourage others to contribute as well so that the only limits to our organization will be our imagination and enthusiasm, rather than finances. For more information about how you can join one of our Circles of Giving and about the benefits associated with each Circle, please visit our  Sponsors tab. Whether you can afford $50 or $5,000, we truly appreciate and value your contribution, and we look forward to showing you how we can transform those donations into high quality music for the Charlotte community as a whole.
