November 18, 2018 November 18, 2018 Janet Julian .entry-header The Monte Carlo Inn and Suites Downtown Markham , 7255 Warden Ave, Markham, ON  https://www.montecarloinns.com/downtown-markham-suites After last year, we tried to locate an hotel that would address some of the things that could be improved to make FKO a better experience for all.  And, of course, it had to be within a reasonable reach of our budget without putting FKO out of business forever. There is a fridge and microwave in every room and free hotel wide WiFi. There is free parking. There is a restaurant.  There is a Continental breakfast, included in the room rate, of pastries and breads, the usual spreads, juices, fruit, tea and coffee. For $6 you can add eggs, bacon or sausage, and home fries.  They are a tiny bit confused about people who stay up all night to * sing * but they are really nice.  Room rates are $115-120 CAD depending on room type, which, in the Greater Toronto Area, is a steal.  The rooms are very nice.  The hotel block is now open. See  Progress Report #1  for more details. The main room is significantly larger than last year and the whole place is a bit more spacious. There is a restaurant (and bar) on the premises as well as a pool and fitness centre. That being said, there is one issue we face. The is no airport shuttle for this hotel so anyone coming without a vehicle will need to consider that. Taxi / Limo estimators show it as $70-80 CAD so this might be a good time to locate a filk buddy or two to share the cost. Fee free to use the FKO Facebook page. .entry-content .entry-meta #post-## Posts navigation ← Older posts .nav-links .navigation #main #primary Search for: Recent Posts FKO 30 Information April 19, 2019 Restaurant Guide April 11, 2019 2019 Songwriting Words April 11, 2019 FKO 29 Pocket Program April 6, 2019 FilKONtario 29 – 5th Progress Report March 27, 2019 FilKONtario 29 – 4th Progress Report March 2, 2019 FilKONtario 29 – 3rd Progress Report March 2, 2019 FilKOntario 29 – 2nd Progress Report March 2, 2019 FilKONtario 29 Update November 18, 2018 We are at a new hotel this year!
