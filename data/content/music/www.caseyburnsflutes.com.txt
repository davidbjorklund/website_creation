Each instrument is meticulously crafted from carefully selected, air-dried tonewoods. Keywork and bands are made from Sterling silver. Casey's flutes are an intelligent balance of tradition and innovation, comprising careful improvements of the traditional acoustical models, and a deceptively modern aesthetic that preserves the best features of their historical forbearers. The experience of over thirty two years and thousands of instruments has resulted in an instrument gratifying for beginner and professional alike. We invite you to learn more about these remarkable flutes, and look forward to discussing with you the appropriate instrument for your needs.
