Here it is 2 days after the wedding and I'm still getting texts about how great Gene was. I really wish I was able to be at cocktail hour as I am the groom but again Gene was great and I would recommend him for any event! He is professional and n time!!! Thanks Gene for everything you did to made the cocktail hour what it was! Beyond happy!!! Review by Robert B. from Tampa, FL on 5/14/2016Â  Gene is a great entertainer, professional and gentlemen. He played all the music our Mom loves (She turned 90) and fun dance music to keep the party moving. He took the time to introduce himself to her, tell her happy birthday and ask for any special request. We had numerous compliments from guest and some asked for his # for their events. Even our family members who are in the entertainment business were impressed! Thanks to Gene the party was a big hit for all.
