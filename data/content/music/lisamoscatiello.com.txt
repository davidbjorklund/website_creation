With a vast repertoire that spans contemporary and traditional folk, Celtic, jazz, and her own original songs, Lisa can often be heard performing lead vocals for Jennifer Cutting's Ocean Orchestra . Lisa's voice has a "room-silencing" quality that both transports and soothes. With her tasteful guitar work, deep musicality and sense of humor, she turns first-time audience members into lifelong fans.
