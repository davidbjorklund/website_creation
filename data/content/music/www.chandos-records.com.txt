Twitter Tweets by @ChandosRecords Latest Videos Latest Reviews “… Sophie Yates is, as ever, excellent throughout and makes a very strong case for these neglected pieces from the Fitzwilliam Collection. Her touch is wonderful and the way she adapts it to suit the differing aspects of each of the different styles presented here is magnificent. Yates also provides the introductory note to the disc as well as the brief notes on each of the pieces. Add to this the notes by Huw Saunders on the beautiful Boni Harpsichord, which itself is a part of the Fitzwilliam Collection and sounds as good as it looks, and the usual Chandos sound quality, and this disc is a real winner.” “… Sophie Yates is, as ever, excellent throughout and makes a very strong case for these neglected pieces from the Fitzwilliam Collection.

They set a very high standard in their earlier recording of his music, but here they surpass it. The acoustic is very good indeed and this helps the Elysian’s perfect diction come through clear and bright, while the beautiful sound of Alexandra Caldon’s violin is perfectly balanced so that it does not detract from the vocal line and is never itself overpowered. The brief introductions to the music in the booklet are very good; full texts are given in English and, where applicable, Latin. This is a very fine disc and a must for any follower of the music of James MacMillan.” “…Throughout this recording, The Elysian Singers under Sam Laughton are excellent, rising to every challenge that James MacMillan poses and coming out shining.

We're continually aware of being in the presence of a remarkably clever, imaginative composer.” “Wallfisch and her band bring out most effectively the character of each movement without ever appearing to be straining to make an effect; the interpretations are entirely natural and full of vitality.
