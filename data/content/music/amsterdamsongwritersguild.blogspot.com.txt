After more than 100 gigs with his band Sailing To Suez, he finally has found some time to fulfill one of his dreams: creating a solo EP. This record, called ‚ÄúLaughing Man‚Äù was inspired by singer-songwriters such as Jeff Buckley, Pete Doherty, John Mayer and Ryan Adams but also by bands like Oasis, The Smiths and R.E.M. Because of this, attention is being paid on strong choruses rather than songs for tearing up, and funky guitar playing instead of epic harmonica solo's. It all should remain a little rock 'n roll, anyway. Tennyson King ‚Äì it‚Äôs a name that evokes notions of classic, literary depth and majesty. But it also has the hallowed ring of the gritty, earthy roots of rock and roll. Songwriters Guild Live is a weekly radioshow in Amsterdam, focussed on singers who write songs.
