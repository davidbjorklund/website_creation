BLUE LION HOME PAGE NEWS LATEST NEWS Update: 7/4/19 IMPORTANT - READ FIRST ORDERING AND SHIPPING DEPARTMENT CLOSED â7/18 through 7/30 Blue Lion's Ordering and Shipping Department (aka Janita) will be closed while Janita is teaching at Dulcimer U in North Carolina.  Online orders placed during this time can't be acknowledged and will not ship until after July 30th, and we are currently not taking new orders for dulcimers (see below). In addition, Robert (who will be handling everything here at Blue Lion and at home) may not be able to return emails or voice mails promptly but he will do his best. If it is important that you reach us please use email if you can.  We appreciate your patience and understanding.   TEMPORARY PAUSE IN ACCEPTING ORDERS Due to an unfortunate series of health issues we are running behind on our production schedule by several months.  When you're a two person shop and one of us goes out with an injury it obviously affects all of our projected timelines.  We don't know how long it will take to resolve this situation and because of that we cannot predict when we can begin a scheduled run until the current run is shipped. As such, we are temporarily suspending accepting any new orders until we have a better idea of what the next several months will do to our work schedule.  We have neither the desire nor intention of retiring any time soon so rest assured Blue Lion is NOT closing its doors.  We are still building dulcimers and plan to keep on as long as we can; we are just not able to build as many or build them as quickly as we used to.  42 years of building guitars and dulcimers have taken its toll on our joints! We thank you for your understanding and patience; as soon as we know more we'll post updates on this page. *** CD SALE *** All CD's are on sale for $10.00 . You can order them online and we'll get them shipped out asap!
