The modern violin has been around since the 16th Century, but before that, folk fiddles had already spread though most of Asia, Africa and Europe. In this site I have assembled detailed information about fiddle styles throughout the world; repertoire, background, history, technique and ornamentation, the most significant players past and present, along with some reviews of related books and albums . Most of the significant fiddle styles are covered; from the best known such as Irish, Scottish, Bluegrass and Old time, along with many of the less well known, such as Canadian, Welsh, Balkan, Chinese and so on. With over 1.5 million hits a year, this site has become one of the most significant sources of fiddle information on the net, and it is still growing   Here's a link to my online Jazz Violin Course, part 1             check out the DPA 4099 mic system:   _____________________________________________________________
