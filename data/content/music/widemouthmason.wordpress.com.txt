Wide Mouth Mason | the official rock band website abides… CSS border #site-title the official rock band website abides… We’re in the process of changing mailing list mediums. For the Wide Mouth Mason website, there is an option to sign up for site updates as we add content. For major announcements, we have set up an mailing list for when new music is in the offing or tour dates (as opposed to one-off gigs) are being scheduled. To ensure you receive news about major Wide Mouth Mason announcements, make sure you sign up here. Our previous ReverbNation-supported mailing list will be phased out in the near future. New music is definitely coming sooner rather than later (and we hope you love the sound of the new album to come!). In the meantime, we’ll see you on the socials: Twitter , Instagram , and Facebook . wide mouth mason widemouthmason Thanks to recent photos tagging Wide Mouth Mason on social media and submissions to the site, we are delighted to update some of Wide Mouth Mason’s 2018 gigs with gig photos!

Thanks @indieseen for this week’s #WideMouthMasonWednesday! #Repost @indieseen with @get_repost ・・・ Throwback to a time when the rug really pulled the room together #widemouthmasonwednesday @widemouthmason This is September 2004 at The University of Manitoba Orientation Week (I wouldn’t become a student there until the following fall) On nearly this date in 1998, we had the honour of opening for and then being summoned after for an RV hang with the great Johnny Winter at the Ottawa Bluesfest. He was very kind to us and it meant a lot. On this exact date five years ago, Johnny passed away. Sat down under a summer tree just now to riff on one of my favourite Winter songs: Mean Town Blues.
