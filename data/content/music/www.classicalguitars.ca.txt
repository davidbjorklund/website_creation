FOR SALE END 2ND ROW OF FOUR GUITARS END FOR SALE begin upper blue line end upper blue line begin letter Welcome Dear Classical Guitarist: Welcome to my website, and thank you for your interest in my instruments. I make a limited number of classical guitars each year. For the past decade and a half I have made doubletop classical guitars exclusively. To date, I have made well over 150 very successful doubletop instruments. The magical sound of my doubletops combines the best of the old and the new, with both the power and volume of the new technology and the musicality and sensitivity of the very best traditional instruments. For the player the results are irresistible -- superb responsiveness to both left and right hand technique in a guitar with great volume and a broad dynamic range. Clarity, colour, fullness, balance, sustain, and beauty of sound of my recent instruments are the best in more than forty years of guitar-making. Please explore my website and contact me with your questions and ideas. Best wishes, Fritz Mueller end letter begin showoff photo 1 -- in the future this will become a slideshow end showoff photo 1 begin maroon line end maroon line begin features list Unsurpassed sound.
