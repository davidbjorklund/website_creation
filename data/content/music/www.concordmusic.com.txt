The cello string set of Solo Versum on top and Tungsten Spirocore on the bottom is ideal for my cello. The Versum have power and warmth and blend well with the Spirocores. The service from Concord was impeccable! I ordered them at 10:30 am on a Monday and they went out the same day and I got them Wednesday. Keep up the great work! Steve L. 07/15/2019 CELLO SET: Versum SOLO and Spirocore Tungsten 👍🏼👍🏼👍🏼 Great strings, I remember tried them in 98 first. I vary between PI, Solo Vision and Dominant. Dominant! Orda 07/12/2019 Violin Set: Dominant with choice of E Excellent Service from Concord Music Supplies I have been using this combination of strings for a while and am very pleased with them. I was especially pleased with the service. I had called to ask about the availability of a cello case strap that I also wanted to order and if the free shipping would get it to me for when I needed it. The person at Concord put me on hold while she checked on the stock. And she sent the strings and strap out later that same day. I got both the strings and strap two days later. TG 07/11/2019 CELLO SET: JARGAR A and D with Helicore G & C Best sound for my violin I have a Curtin & Alf violin and Mr. Curtin recommended EP Strings when I bought the violin in 1993. I have tried other strings but always come back to EP. My violin has a bright and clear sound and these strings add a level of sweetness. I play professionally and also teach. Cathyanne N. 07/10/2019 Evah Pirazzi Violin Set with Goldsteel E Fabulous rosin - Finally, the perfect container! This rosin is wonderful, nice sound, with good stick (I've used the dark). I use it for cello but it also works well for little violin bows that may not have hair in the best condition and need more grip. The container is the best selling point though. Perfect for kids (or accident prone adults) who need better quality rosin than the wood block style, but still want protection from drops. Love having the plastic box integrated - with the flip top lid it's fully protected and there are no parts to get lost or separated, and the twist dial on the bottom is genius for using the rosin without developing a groove. I love the ease throwing this rosin in my purse, without a cardboard box that gets mangled or the lid toppled off. I recommend this to all my students. It's good quality, lasts and won't get broken or the container lost. It's a definite win! HMRT 06/27/2019 Kaplan Premium Rosin Great tone in the right conditions I am greatly enjoying the warm, resonant tone of these Pirastro Passione viola strings. I’m no expert in strings, and I haven’t branched out too much from D’Adario helicore medium tension strings, but these definitely have a tone that reminds me of a hug from Grandma. It has been an adjustment for me to get used to the amount of stretching these strings require. With the helicores, I would tune them slightly sharp, and they would settle into tune within a day or two with no more peg turning (I have fine tuners). These have taken about two weeks to finally stay close to staying in tune with multiple peg turns a day. The complaint that I have with them has to do with their sensitivity. I have had several occasions where the D and the A string produce a buzzy or whistle-like tone, not producing a true note. This has happened with both open notes as well as different fingerings on the strings. I am no professional, but in all my years of playing (over 20), I have never had this problem. I have also found that they are extremely sensitive to other vibrations around me, so that intensifies my struggle. They also seem to be much more finicky when it comes to temperature and humidity fluctuations. Overall, I think these are wonderful solo strings for a very controlled environment. As I said, they truly have a beautiful tone that I have been looking for. However, for my situation of playing in such diverse situations (i.e. outdoors, indoors, solo, in a small band, surrounded by horns, in a large band, etc.), it feels a bit like having to cater to an aristocratic relative. I will enjoy their quality while I have them though. It is becoming an enjoyable experience to work with them in my practice at home, and I may continue to buy the G and C strings. SW 06/27/2019 Passione Viola Set, Gut core Pricy, but absolutely worth it This is now an essential part of my violin and viola, and should be on everyone's instrument. The Mberg tuner is only three pieces total: an exquisitely machined titanium piece, a gold mounting washer, and a gold tuner screw. The picture truly does not do justice to the craftsmanship put into these tiny things; the milling work is genuinely flawless. I installed my first tuner on my violin about a year ago and have noticed a few things: 1. The E string is louder and fuller- noticeably so 2. It never rattles 3. Installing strings is super easy and I have not broken a single string while using this tuner 4. It never digs into the top of my violin; the threads are so precise it only adjusts about 3mm vertically 5. Most importantly, tuning is super fast and easy. The machining is so precise, it feels effortless to turn the screw. I now have one of these tuners on my violin and my viola, and have installed them on many of my student's instruments as well. These are an outstanding addition to any instrument and well worth the price. Drew 06/25/2019 Mberg Ultra Light Titanium Fine Tuner for Violin or Viola New optional A is a winner I have written previously about the Cannone medium strings which I like very much. I put on a new set about a week ago with the optional "warm A". This changes things quite a lot. The A changes the sound of all the strings, which for my Panormo, which is a Strad model, accentuates what I call "peachfuzz" harmonics... high harmonics on all the strings, adding a good amount of the purity and sound of a real strad under your ear. If you like high harmonics, this set up is remarkable. Perhaps not as punchy as without the "warm A", but wonderful quality, and sounds and plays under your ear like a fine 18th century Italian instrument. The G string responds quicker as well. Sweet. Bravo. Wren C. 06/23/2019 Larsen Il Cannone Strings-Bonus set! Wonderful strings! I bought these to replace a set of Dominants, and I couldn't be happier. They have lovely tone colors, and they don't get "fuzzy" as you get into higher positions on the lower strings. The E really sings. Very responsive, easy to play. Highly recommended! DF 06/18/2019 Vision Solo Violin Set Silver D VIS101 a really good little thing for me! I first started to use a GelRest Micro on my viola a few months ago and it was perfect for me. Then a week ago I decided to try it on the violin I keep in the same case --PERFECT! I've now got one of these in each of the cases I might leave home with and ALL the other shoulder rests I've used over the past 50 years are either in my "used shoulder rest drawer" or have been gifted to other players. I do use a low shoulder rest, and in fact, for the first 30 years of my playing I used no shoulder rest at all. A. V. 06/17/2019 The Micro Gelrest Shoulder Pad FAST shipping of exactly what I ordered, wide range, great price. I had to find a new string merchant, because the big sites were out of my brand, the last shop I tried took a week to ship, and I needed strings ASAP. Concord had warm reviews on string forums, and I remembered buying my childhood music books from a Concord Music in DE. I don't know if this is the same co., but online Concord had my strings, in a wider range of gauges than usual, and on sale. So I took a shot (with a little note begging for speed). And by God, they got my strings in the mail the next day, giving me time to break them in before the gig. I will definitely be shopping with Concord in the future. Thank you so much! Louise S. 05/31/2019 Concord Musical Supplies great strings These are the strings I prefer for my violin. They always give me good tone. I have been happy with them for many years. AT 05/28/2019 Violin Set: Dominant with choice of E Great Company to order from! Helicore's are my favorite strings! Concord Musical Supplies has the best prices and they always process and ship items amazingly fast! B.N 05/22/2019 Helicore Violin String Set (aluminum wound E) I love Eudoxa! I use Eudoxa A-D-G and Oliv C and find it the very best of all worlds -- the lower tension and relaxed feeling under the hand of any gut strings; the easier response as a result; and the warmth and color completely missing in synthetic strings. And Eudoxa strings especially stretch out very quickly -- I broke an A-string recently and within a day, the new one was completely stable and holding pitch 100%. Jason C. 05/20/2019 Eudoxa Cello A String The Best Place For Fiddle Strings Because I customize my set, ordering strings is usually frustrating. But with Concord, it was perfectly simple! Concord had all of the brands and gauges I like in my custom set, the website was easy to use, and I got what I ordered quickly. I also saved money. Concord has my loyalty. Shawn C. 05/17/2019 Concord Musical Supplies extremely fast delivery. Cordial and knowledgeable support staff Andrw S. 05/09/2019 Spirocore Cello Tungsten C String Powerful clarity These strings are the most clear, powerful, strings I have tried so far. I'm in love and will definitely purchase them in the future. It's pricey, but an investment you won't regret! Mark S. 04/27/2019 Perpetual Cello C String-5 Options Wonderful strings! This is my third set, now all my cellos wear Versum! They are so smooth and rich on mine, I find that even the edgy 2013 cello is made calmer and richer. Concord has the best prices for strings hands down. The Versums are still expensive, but they last a long time and I think they would enhance ANY cello, and help bring out the best qualities. And they are easy to play on, too. Jan 04/24/2019 Versum Cello Set VE400 I only wish I had switched to Pirazzi Golds sooner. They sound great on my Hosmer repaired Carlo Micelli violin. Fred W. 04/24/2019 Evah Pirazzi Gold violin set, Gold G 4150 Love it! It’s amazing! Fresh out of the box and without major adjustments, it already felt better than my previous one. Overall, this shoulder rest opened up my sound and created more ring to my tone. It helped bring out my lower range with more resonance and clarity, and it’s SO LIGHT. I didn’t realize how heavy my viola was before the switch. My viola feels more stable on my shoulder, and I’m now able to play with my left arm moving more freely and without restriction. I will never go back. sparkviola 04/20/2019 KorfkerRest 2 Viola Shoulder Rest Best Larsen Strings I have used both the Virtuoso and Cannone strings on my violin, a Panormo strad model, 1820. The Virtuoso strings have a lovely sound under the ear and speak very well. An enjoyable string which speaks very well. I have tried both the medium and "Soloist" gauge Cannone strings. I much prefer the medium gauge. These strings have a wonderful bright, and yet rich sound with a lot of complex harmonics. If you have a bright, soprano sounding violin, you might think that a darker sounding string would be a good balance... however, the medium Cannone's have quality, more power than the Virtuoso's, and harmonics which make a bright violin really sing with a lot of power, ease of playing, and Quality of sound. Bravo to Larsen! Wren C. 04/09/2019 Larsen Il Cannone Strings-Bonus set! New strings New strings sounded great, very well satisfied Lynn M. 04/05/2019 Helicore Violin String Set (aluminum wound E) The BEST gut strings, PERIOD... They break in fast, and they stay in tune MUCH better than any other gut strings I’ve ever tried. They have the traditional warm tone the gut strings give you, of course... I’ve used them for several years now, and am really happy with them... Peter 04/03/2019 Passione Viola Set, Gut core Passion A and D I have used both the A and D strings on my 1982 Roth cello. They produce a warm tone, but may take time to settle in. The A goes particularly well with Eva Pirazzi Soloist D string or set. The A string had a small diameter and had a variety of colors. It also projects well in forte passages. A great and surprisingly affordable string. The d string has a warm round sound. SC 03/28/2019 Passione Cello A String A nice string. Excellent service from Concord as usual. David G. 03/14/2019 Jargar Special Cello D String Wonderful strings Evah Golds are one of my top favorite choices for great volume, deep, rich tone quality, ease of playing and sheer beauty of sound. And also very smooth and easy to finger. Even tone and depth across all four strings, they bring out the best in my cello. Jan 03/11/2019 Evah Pirazzi Gold Cello Set 3350 Great all around string I have tried many different strings over the years and I have found that there Eva Pirazzi Gold strings work well on average cellos as well as expensive, The provide a rich projecting sound that is pleasant to the player as well as the listener. Kenneth S. 03/11/2019 Evah Pirazzi Gold Cello D 3352 Good strings I'm highly recommend Perpetual. It's good sounding and tuning strings!! Lev R. 02/22/2019 Perpetual Violin Strings Reliable Concord has been my go to for years. They are remarkably fast, I have always gotten what I ordered and the prices are good. Many thanks for the years of service! GH 01/21/2019 Spirocore Cello Tungsten C String The best lightweight case Very ergonomic, very light, very strong. The best suspension system I've seen: the instrument barely touches the case but is well secured. The straps are also well designed and comfortable; you don't notice you're carrying a violin on your back. The outside surface of the case does scratch easily, but you'd rather scratch your case than your fiddle... Dan C. 01/19/2019 Bam Hightech Contoured Violin Case Happy Customer! Strings are more than I could ever imagine! Brandon T. 01/01/2019 Magnacore Cello Set Awesome The most warm, resonant sounding C string I've played on. Prefer the tungsten spiral over Versum Solo and Larsen Magnacore. Can't go wrong! Sarah B. 12/12/2018 Spirocore Cello Tungsten C String What a pleasant surprise! I ordered both the Jargar A and D Superior in the Forte gauge and I have been so happy with the qualities they have brought to my cello. My cello is on the darker side tonally and I feel that these strings allow my cello to keep it's natural color while giving it a boost in projection. Under the ear it sounds great and the strings are quick to respond to both left and right hands. Having played practically every A, D soloist string available(Permanent Soloist being my favorite prior to Jargar Superior), I will happily keep these strings on my cello going forward.
