We're really pleased to announce that we have secured Bablake School, Coventry as our new rehearsal venue for the coming season for our symphony orchestra. More details to follow. First rehearsal is Friday 6th September. New players welcome, all instruments. Please visit the join us section for more information. Gifted young musicians deserve this opportunity to play.
