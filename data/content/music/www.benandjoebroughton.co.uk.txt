Joe became a thoughtful, wonderfully inventive and sought-after player whose drive and musicianship galvanised any lineup with whom he played. Personally, I am one who loves the idea of blood relations making music together, and now that, after something of a gap, these two are back working together again, the prospect  is very exciting indeed. The years will have added thought to the youthful flash but the swagger will still be in evidence I have no doubt - along with the sheer delight in doing the job really well. This is  a welcome return." - Martin Carthy BEGIN FASTCOUNTER CODE
