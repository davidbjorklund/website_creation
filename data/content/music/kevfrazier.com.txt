Many of you already know the wonderful music Kevin Frazier delivers when playing smooth jazz saxophone to the grooves of David Sanborn, Boney James, Grover Washington Jr. and others. Kevin was featured on the collaboration CD “Sierra Nights” which includes incredible musicians from across the country.  Band members include Mo Pleasure on bass, keys, trumpet, and flugelhorn (musical director for Michael Jackson’s “This is it”), Oscar Seaton on drums (toured with Bozz Skaggs, Lionel Ritchie, and Grover Washington Jr.), Forrest “Frosty” Lawson on trumpet, flugelhorn, trombone, and sax (played with the Village People, John Sembello, Branford Marsalis, Chuck Mangione). We called the band “West Coast”, as most of the players and the two writers Tim Stretton and Ruben Diaz were on the west coast. Kevin is currently the General Manager of the Empress Theatre in Vallejo and has had the pleasure of sitting in with many popular bay area musicians that perform at the theatre.  He also plays with the Jazz Explosion Band at the Union Hotel in Benicia on Thursday evenings. Kevin’s smooth jazz saxophone is perfect for corporate events, weddings, clubs, and wineries. He also enjoys helping non-profit organizations by donating his time to play at important bay area events throughout the year. Kevin Frazier plays throughout Northern California, the Bay Area, Solano County, Marin County and the Napa Valley. He also plays with a number of popular bay area bands (check out the video page to see a “live” video clips). Start off your private party with a light smooth jazz duo, then get the party dancing with a full band.    Share This Page .entry-content 5 comments Todd Newman - March 31, 2014 5:56 pm Look at all that white hair greetings old friend Log in to Reply #comment-## Julie and Bob Bedoya - September 17, 2014 8:25 am Kevin played at our post-wedding sunset dinner cruise aboard “The Journey” this past Sunday. While it HAD to be challenging playing his sax on a “moving” stage, Kevin never missed a beat. His music provided the exact soulful, relaxed ambience we were looking for. Thank you so much!

Weather you “are music” or merely enjoy listening, you must treat your ears to an opportunity to experience Mr. Frazier’s talented interpretations of all genres of music. Looking forward to hearing music from Mr. Frazier’s again. Ciao until then!!
