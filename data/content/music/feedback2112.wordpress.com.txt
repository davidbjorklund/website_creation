FeedBack - A Tribute to RUSH | Rush Tribute Band BLOG FeedBack – A Tribute to RUSH Rush Tribute Band BLOG Band time Posted in Jokes on March 7, 2010 by Gavin It’s getting hard to find rehearsal time with every member of the band working full time. We are looking for a donation of a billion gagillion dollars in order to do this full time. Large bills gladly accepted. 😉 Advertisements 2 Comments » Band Update – March 4 2010 Posted in 1 on March 4, 2010 by Gavin It’s been an interesting couple of weeks for the band. A real learning experience actually. With Matt leaving the band suddenly, we were faced with a few issues: What is the future of the band How will the band deal with this bump in the road internally Will anyone follow Matt and leave as well I’m happy to say that Lee, Frank and myself have all reiterated our commitment to each other and “FeedBack”. None of us even considered moving on and our resolve is stronger than ever. I think we all learned a valuable lesson that will help the band succeed down the road. Problems – no – CHALLENGES – will surface over time. It’s how we as a unit handle these challenges that will partly define our success or failure. As long as we remember our goals, and don’t let the challenges DEFINE who we are we can overcome. What is the future of the band? This phase in our “development” has allowed the three of us to re-affirm to each other and to ourselves that what we’re doing is important to us individually and as a group. Over the next few weeks we will be discussing and defining our goals and would like to share them with you – the RUSH (and hopefully FeedBack) fans. So please stay tuned, subscribe to our blog here  and we look forward to seeing you out there!
