MBO Home                             The Beethoven Society was founded in 1888 and has met without a break since then. The Society gives classical music concerts in aid of both local and national charities. We do not purely perform works by Beethoven; rather the name is kept as a tribute to the long and illustrious history of the orchestra.  We are a group of musicians dedicated to playing good music, enjoying ourselves, and helping to raise money for charities at the same time. Please come and support us, see the About Us page to see Maps of our usual rehearsal and concert venues. If you've never been to our concerts before, come and try something different for free. If you have, we hope you enjoyed our concerts and will keep supporting us. We currently have vacancies for string players.

The culmination of our year will be Dvoraks Symphony No. 9 (From the New World) one of the best loved of orchestral works. This will provide the season with an energetic and spirited finale.
