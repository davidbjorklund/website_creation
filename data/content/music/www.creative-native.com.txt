These are songs I’ve been writing for over fifty years, and what troubles people today are still the same damn issues from 30-40-50 years ago: war, oppression, inequity, violence, rankism of all kinds, the pecking order, bullying, racketeering and systemic greed. Some of these songs come from the other side of that: positivity, common sense, romance, equity and enthusiasm for life. I’ve found that a song can be more effective than a 400-page textbook. It’s immediate and replicable, portable and efficient, easy to understand – and sometimes you can dance to it. Effective songs are shared, person-to-person, by artists and friends, as opposed to news stories that are marketed by the fellas who may own the town, the media, the company store and the mine. I hope you use these songs, share them, and that they inspire change and your own voice. It might seem strange that along with the new ones, I re-recorded and updated some of these songs from the past using current technologies and new instrumentations – giving a new life to them from today’s perspective. The thing is, some of these songs were too controversial for radio play when they first came out, so nobody ever heard them, and now is my chance to offer them to new generations of like-minded people dealing with these same concerns. It’s like the play is the same but the actors are new. I really want this collection of songs to be like medicine, to be of some help or encouragement, to maybe do some good. Songs can motivate you and advance your own ideas, encourage and support collaborations and be part of making change globally and at home. They do that for me and I hope this album can be positive and provide thoughts and remedies that rock your world and inspire new ideas of your own. ~ Buffy     NEWS     2019 Summer & Fall Tour Dates This summer and fall, Buffy Sainte-Marie hits the road for tour dates in the following cities: July 11-13 - Samuelsberg, Norway - Riddu Riđđu Festival August 24 - Whistler, BC, Canada - Whistler Olympic Plaza Pavilion **FREE ADMISSION** August 26 - Toronto, ON, Canada - Canadian National Exhibition Bandshell September 13 - Hamilton, ON, Canada - Supercrawl **FREE ADMISSION** September ... more Indigenous Day Live 2019 - June 22 Buffy Sainte-Marie will perform at APTN's Indigenous Day Live 2019 on Saturday, June 22 at The Forks in Winnipeg, MB.
