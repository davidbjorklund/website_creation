 404: Page not found This error is generated when there was no web page with the name you specified at the web site. Troubleshooting suggestions: Ensure the page you are linking to exists in the correct folder. Check your file name for case sensitivity . Index.htm is not the same as index.htm! Temporarily disable any rewrite rules by renaming your .htaccess file if it exists.
