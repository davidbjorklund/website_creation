Carl Peterson, Scottish Folksinger Home Biography Reviews Schedule Music Books Promo Kit Extras Privacy Policy Carl's Blog Follow @CarlPeterson5 Carl's music on CDBaby "One man. One guitar. One incredible concert." A performance by Carl Peterson, whether for a few thousand people or for a few dozen, is best described as a warm, everyone-involved, familiar evening-at-home experience. And home is where Carl Peterson was first introduced to music and song. He learned the traditional songs of Scotland, Ireland, and England, as well as contemporary music of the times, from family and friends alike. After learning to play guitar and banjo, Carl added American folk songs and storytelling to his repertoire, and took it all from Scotland to Canada, then later to America, via radio and television.

Peterson combines fact, folklore, and fantasy into Ewan Colin Coupar and a Touch of the Fae, a story featuring a cast of Rockkin, Elves, Brownies, and Urisks, among other faerie folk, who mingle with humans in our own world. These encounters result in children who have a âtouch of the Faeâ through bloodline or other connections. Among these special children is Ewan Colin Coupar, a young boy who grew up in England but has now returned to his birthplace in Greenock, Scotland. Amid the tumultuous post-WWII atmosphere, he is delighted to find an escape from his worldly troubles in the wondrous realm of the Fae. Joining a number of kindred spiritsâother children who possess a touch of the Fae as well as a minister pursuing his interest in faerie beings in spite of his faithâEwan embarks on several adventures and befriends many faeries, including a Druid spirit named Winthrop. Little do they know that sinister forces are at work, seeking to steal the secrets of the past and the ancient knowledge of the Fae. Can Ewan and his friends put a stop to their malevolent plans?

I fortunately had my camera with me and quickly pulled over, and took pictures. Is this what Pictish King Angus and his men saw before their battle? According to tradition, St. Andrew was put to death by the Romans in Patras, Southern Greece by being crucified on a diagonal cross. The diagonal shape of this cross is said to be the basis for the Cross of St. Andrew which appears on the Scottish Flag. One legend of St. Andrew involves the Pictish King Angus. When faced with a large invading army, King Angus prayed to St Andrew for divine guidance. A saltire (the diagonal cross) appeared in the shape of a white cloud against the blue sky. Angus won a decisive victory and decreed that Andrew would be the patron saint of his country. See more St Andrews Cross pictures and read more about St Andrew and the Flag Here .
