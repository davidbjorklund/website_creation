There's a lot here to explore, but there are many more than what is shown here, so if something intrigues you, or you have something special in mind, send me an email and we can talk about it. Davis Guitar Works is dedicated to serving the guitarist that has been frustrated by always having to compromise one aspect of their "ideal guitar" at the expense of achieving another. All of Davis Guitar Works' instruments receive my undivided attention throughout all stages of design, development, wood and hardware selection, assembly, fit, finish, set up and delivery. Enjoy your visit, and please feel free to contact me with any questions you may have. We can explore the possibility of my crafting your own custom guitar or if you'd like to have your own guitar customized or restored.
