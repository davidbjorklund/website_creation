In the time since then Spacemuffin s have earned the reputation as “the world’s finest hand crafted electronic drum set” and been awarded no less than 4 full utility patents.  We are the originator of the “Acoustically Formatted Electronic drum. We did it first. We do it best!   We were first to address the issues of motor memory and to recognize the damage to wrists, elbows and knees that resulted from Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In 1997, we became the first and only company, ever, to produce a turnkey Electro-Percussion system conceived, designed and manufactured in North America!  We are one of only two manufacturers on Earth with a full electronic and acoustic line and stand alone in Electro-Acoustic technology with our “X” Series! These are achievements in which we take great pride. All Spacemuffins Electro Percussion Systems are formatted to look, feel and play, as close to Acoustic, as anything you’ll ever swing a stick at!  Built by hand, without compromise, to deliver unparalleled tracking, sensitivity and real world dynamics, Spacemuffins have set the standard by which all other Electro-Percussion systems are measured. So as the rest of the industry punches out their cookie cutter sets, rest assured the visceral lives on at Boom Theory. Somebody held it, somebody tested it, and somebody loved it as much as we know you will. The difference is passion! end container end main-wrap © BoomTheoryCorp 7902 NE Day Rd W, Bainbridge Island, WA 98110  (253) 813-2666 Info@boomtheory.com  BoomTheoryCorp FB end container end footer-wrap
