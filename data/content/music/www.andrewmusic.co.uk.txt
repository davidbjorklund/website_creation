We believe having fun while learning is inseparable from achieving high standards of musical excellence and so strive to make the whole experience as enjoyable and easy as possible. Athough we all share this fundamental view we each operate independently within our own teaching spaces, and issue our own terms & conditions. This reflects our wonderfully diverse musical backgrounds across classical, jazz, pop and world-music genres and allows us the freedom to follow our individual strengths and teach creatively and flexibly in the comfort of our own homes or studios at times convenient to all. We teach all ages and abilities and offer lessons for pleasure, for more formal attainment in exams and competitive festivals, and for preparation for auditions, concerts, recordings etc. We also come together to present public concerts of pupils' (and our own) performance and composition. So please come in! Choose a teacher and ask them for details. Watch a lesson and take a trial. Experience our refreshingly different approach. Let's make music! Andrew Claxton principal/founder Â
