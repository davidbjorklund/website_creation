They are particularly poignant on this day, as the final few hours of 2018 fall away into the darkness of the night, and the dawn of the New Year beckons. Like a sailboat that can never sail directly into the wind but has to tack and gybe in crooked lines towards the destination, so our lives take on the same pattern. But with eyes fixed on the Alpha and Omega, the one of whom St. Augustine recognised as 'Beauty ever Ancient and ever New', we will safely reach our final destination. May He be our All in All. May He be with us as we take our first breath in the New Year and may we stay in His Light till the Eternal Light is All in All. Wishing you and your loved ones a Blessed 2019 filled with Peace and Joy!
