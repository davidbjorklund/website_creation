Ochoa has developed a unique sound that melded almost all forms of music – traditional and modern – into a breathtaking sonic adventure.” Raul D’Gama – Latin Jazz Network “Following the previous acclaimed releases by his nonet Cimarrón, Havana-born (and Toronto-based) guitarist, vocalist and composer Luis Mario Ochoa delivers a subtler and more jazz-tinged offering in Momentos Cubanos.” Rebeca Mauleón “Ochoa once again convincingly takes Cuban music, embellishes it with his imagination and comes up with an album that is difficult to ignore.” Jerry D’Souza – All About Jazz “Luis Mario Ochoa is full of fire, finesse and authenticity” Bill Milkowski – Jazz Times Magazine .entry-content .entry-container #post #main .wrapper #content Copyright © 2019 Luis Mario Ochoa All Rights Reserved .wrapper #site-generator #colophon #page Scroll Up Home About Me Biography Reviews Calendar CD Listen/Purchase Momentos Cubanos (2008) Cimarron: Luis Mario Ochoa & Friends (2005) La Fiesta (2000) My Bands Luis Mario Ochoa Acoustic Quintet Cuba Tradicional Sextet Cimarron – Latin Fusion Tentet Gallery Videos Contact #mobile-header-left-nav ngg_resource_manager_marker
