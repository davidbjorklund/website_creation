 End of StatCounter Code <hs:title> Ringing Strings Bowed Psalteries </hs:title> <hs:element44> 6-2-19  Yes, I'm still kicking.  It has been a while since a website update.  I have slowed down my business as I'm am nearing retirement.  This doesn't mean I have stopped building psalteries.  I am currently only building as I have orders come in.  Two tenor psalteries in progress for customers.  You can do the same thing, have me build a psalteries out of the wood choices I have available.  When finished, you would have the opportunity to purchase it.  No obligation and no down payment.  If you decide you don't want it, I'll make it available to the next customer in line. My Gmail account seems to be acting up.  My sent emails appear to be sent from my end, but not all are being received by my costomers.  I'm trying top figure it out.  If you have sent me an email inquiry about something, please follow up with a call or text my phone (865-660-4026) I have stopped taking International orders.  A recent experience with a shipment to Germany has led me to knowing it is not worth the hassle.  Sales to US only. I have stopped building thesmall soprano and baritone models.  I still plan to keep building the Alto, Tenor, and D Tenor psalteries.  No new baritone orders will be taken. </hs:element44> <hs:element2> Ringing Strings Bowed Psalteries handcrafted by Rick Long Clinton, Tennessee (865) 660-4026   psalteryman@gmail.com </hs:element2> <hs:element7> Home Alto Tenor D Tenor Baritone Psaltery Bows Songbooks Accessories How to Order How to Play The Workshop FAQ Songs to Learn Private Lessons Favorite Quotes Gathering </hs:element7> <hs:element9> </hs:element9> <hs:element10> </hs:element10> <hs:element11> </hs:element11> <hs:element12> </hs:element12> <hs:element25> </hs:element25> <hs:element45> Scroll Down to See What's New </hs:element45> <hs:element42> </hs:element42> <hs:element13> WELCOME Here in my little corner of the "web" you will find - Handcrafted Bowed Psalteries Accessories Helpful Information Pride in Workmanship and Service I have been building and playing bowed psalteries for the past 39 years.  A love of music and woodworking began at an early age.  At my fathers side, I became familiar with walnut, cherry, cedar and other woods native to North America.   I gained great love and respect for the use of these materials  The projects we completed provided the skills required for creating the beautiful instruments you find here today.  My love for music came from my mother, she is very talented and can play the piano really great by ear. Quality and service are my top priorities.  My long experience in playing the bowed psaltery gives me the knowledge to know what works well and what doesn't.  My goal is to create the very best bowed psalteries available anywhere. I love to tinker and come up with new designs.  Some new ideas come out of my own head.  I do listen to customers, many design changes have come from customer comments and wishes. Please take a moment to browse the site.  See the variety of figured woods used.   Listen to the samples of my recordings.  Visit my workshop page and see where these wonderful instruments are made.  I take pride in offering lots of sound clips and videos, showing how my psalteries sound and are played.  I even give you some sound clip examples of each psaltery I list for sale.  I believe I am the only builder that offers this on their web site.  The only better way to shop and compare, is to be standing in my workshop trying them out in person.  You are even welcome to travel to East Tennessee to do that.  I do all this because I am very proud of the quality bowed psalteries that I build and want you to be able to judge them for yourself. Enjoy your time here, come back and visit often. </hs:element13> <hs:element49> </hs:element49> <hs:element50> </hs:element50> <hs:element51> </hs:element51> <hs:element52> </hs:element52> <hs:element54> </hs:element54> <hs:element55> </hs:element55> <hs:element59> </hs:element59> <hs:element60> </hs:element60> <hs:element61> </hs:element61> <hs:element62> </hs:element62> <hs:element63> </hs:element63> <hs:element64> </hs:element64> <hs:element65> </hs:element65> <hs:element66> </hs:element66> <hs:element67> </hs:element67> <hs:element68> </hs:element68> <hs:element69> </hs:element69> <hs:element70> </hs:element70> <hs:element74> Blue is Alto Yellow is Tenor Red is Baritone Purple is D Tenor </hs:element74> <hs:element75> Here's how the voices of all the different models of psalteries I build, compared to the piano keyboard in pitch.  You can clearly see that they all have quite a few notes in common.  Some folks are confused by the names soprano, tenor, and baritone, but they are just names to distinguish each model I build.  Other builders may have a different opinion of what they call the psalteries they build.  The important thing to consider is the range of notes, from the lowest to the highest.  This will tell you what to expect.  The first sound clip listed by each psaltery I offer for sale, gives you something to listen to and hear the entire range of notes.  Every builder should do the same, so you have a chance to hear and compare.  Even with some of the notes overlapping, there are still differences in tone.  The has a lot to do with the size of the psaltery soundbox and the type and size of strings used. </hs:element75> <hs:element77> </hs:element77> <hs:element78> </hs:element78> <hs:element79> Click here to go to my new Ringing Strings Bowed Psaltery Facebook page.  I'll be putting things on there that you won't see on my website.  Be sure to like the page to receive notifications of new content.  The Facebook page will also give you another way to contact me for questions, post them on there or pm me. </hs:element79> <hs:element81> Home    Alto     Tenor     Baritone      Accessories      D Tenor         How to Order   Bows     How to Play      The Workshop         FAQ          Songs to Learn     Private Lessons          Favorite Quotes Copyright Ringing Strings Music 2004-2019  All Rights Reserved </hs:element81> <hs:element82> 2019 Bowed Psaltery Gathering I am placing this on my site to announce the 2019 Gathering.  I no longer host this event.  It will be hosted by Gail VanAmberg, so all contact for information and registration should go directly to her.  I have a copy of her flyer posted here on my site.  It has her email and mailing address. </hs:element82> <hs:footer> Website Designed at Homestead™ Make a Website for Your Business </hs:footer> <hs:realtracker> </hs:realtracker>
