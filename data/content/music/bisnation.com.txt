We have more gigs on the way!  It’s a pleasure to be back at Long Division Festival in Wakefield amongst many great bands (the amazing Art Brut is one and 100’s more still to be announced).  And, due to popular demand we are back at the Lexington in London with a daytime show AND an evening one with Slime City (a hot ‘un for 2019 and trust us, they’re very good!).  There’s also the Newcastle gig we mentioned late last year, and we have a couple more festivals in July and August to announce when we’re allowed to.  We apologise we aren’t doing long tours or have the finances to go outside the UK (unless someone out there offers us something silly) so with our kids and businesses we’ll just be doing as many mini tours and one-off’s as possible.  It’s all very exciting so watch this space! Tickets for Long Division are available here: http://longdivisionfestival.co.uk/tickets and tickets for the Lexington in London go on sale Monday morning.  The last gig sold out and the evening one is with Slime City so don’t delay!  Hope to see you soon!

This morning I met with them for the second time and they have confirmed that they will provide Free Bis Passes for all concert goers, when you buy a ticket for the gig complementary bis travel will be provided by LNFG/First Bus. More will be revealed in the coming weeks and months. The shows will be launched in or around November when we will also start arranging pre-orders of the album” This is possibly just the first mad announcement of many to come and more details to follow :) Tweet ∞ Permalink Posted 9 months ago Tweet this 2 notes It’s a wee while away but we’re proud to say that we’ll be back in Newcastle for the Hapless Hootenanny 2019 all-dayer event next year!  Join us at the Cluny , Lime Street, 22nd June, other bands TBA.   Tweet ∞ Permalink Posted 11 months ago Tweet this 2 notes London - we’re coming back!  Tickets on sale tomorrow 12pm so grab ‘em fast :)  Sunday 18th November hosted by Guided Missile www.wegottickets.com The Lexington , 96-98 Pentonville Road, N1 9JB London, Tweet ∞ Permalink Posted 12 months ago Tweet this We play Shiiine Festival in Minehead in November.  We’re the Saturday 17th 10pm btw.  Never been on a bill with Altern8 and the Primitives before :)   Tickets available www.shiiineon.com/tickets and if you use code NCB10 you get a discounted rate.   Tweet ∞ Permalink Posted 1 year ago Tweet this We’ll be playing this festival near Inverness on June 16th https://www.facebook.com/woodzfest Tweet ∞ Permalink Posted 1 year ago Tweet this 1 note Older
