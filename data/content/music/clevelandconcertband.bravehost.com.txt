For details about our C.Ds. please see the News Page. To order a C.D. please click here .                      Click below to see us on Facebook   Cleveland Concert Band was formed in January 2007 by a very small group of dedicated musicians who came from Middlesbrough, Eston, Northallerton, Guisborough, New Marske, Redcar, Dormanstown and other places surrounded by the Cleveland Hills in the North East of England. We have grown steadily in numbers since our first rehearsal of only ten players. We are a very happy and content team of part-time musicians who enjoy the great company of likeminded people of all age groups and abilities. We are all amateurs and have no professional players within our band.   The band actively support local charities and groups who would like to raise money for good causes. We are a very happy band that will always give our audience a great concert to remember, for all the right reasons. The band can perform music such as the Old time songs, Dance, Jazz, songs from the top musical shows as well a s perform some of the modern pop songs to make most occasions that bit special. We have something for every member of the family to enjoy and we don't charge a fortune for live music like some concert windbands. Any fees charged go towards the running costs of the band.  Latest News     .........Next concert is on 28th July...See Concerts for details............    Looking for a friendly band?
