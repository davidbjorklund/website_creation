You are the best! I have taken lessons from several teachers over the years but none have specialized in bluegrass. I felt like I was being bogged down with a lot of material that really didn't relate to bluegrass. It was so refreshing to see that all the material you taught was spot-on for bluegrass. I can play all the material pretty well now but need to work on increasing the speed and memorizing it all. Excited to see that I will end up with a great collection of tunes I can play with and for family and friends.
