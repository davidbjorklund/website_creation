When you visit or send your music files to Two Cats Music , you will primarily be working with Ben Travis, the owner and lead audio engineer.  In his words...     "I ’m a Nashville-based audio engineer, producer, and  musician, as well as an independent artist and songwriter.    I take you from start to finish, beginning with your songs as they are, and ending with a professionally recorded song, EP, or entire album, all availa ble on over 90 digital music sharing sites like iTunes and Spotify. I grew up in a small town in Kentucky called Dawson Springs, and learned to play the piano by watching my dad play. I then attended Belmont University in Nashville, TN, and graduated with a degree in music in 1996. Since then, I have written and recorded several albums for myself and others, played keyboards and sung background vocals for other Nashville artists, and performed my own music live around town.  I hope you'll consider recording with me at Two Cats Music.  I think you'll find that I will help you take your songs and put them together so that they sound the way you always hoped they could. As a fellow songwriter and artist, I try to understand your music in a personal way and help you make it the best it can be."     Request a quote!         "Working with Ben Travis was like adding a member to our band. He instantly grasped our sound and vision and worked tirelessly to capture the perfect product we were looking for! It was a natural, relaxing, yet inspiring atmosphere. We're looking forward to booking more time.”  - Jonny Welch ( DNNYNJNNY )      "The end product was better than I imagined!  His studio gave me a professional sounding EP that I was proud to put on the market and share with record labels and other artists."      - Garrett Baker   “Working with Ben was incredible, he understood exactly what I wanted to do and executed the recording process perfectly.  I would absolutely recommend Ben to other singers, songwriters or musicians who want to record their music."    - Billy Ray Cunningham, Jr.   ...more testimonials here   -TWITTER FEED   .entry #content .grid_7 Recorded at Two Cats mute unmute play pause Update Required To play the media you will need to either update your browser to a recent version or update your Flash plugin . .inner_container .widget_container .widget_basic Facebook ---------FACEBOOK .widget_container .widget_basic twitter ---------TWITTER follow Follow @twocatsmusic .widget_container .widget_basic INSTAGRAM ---------INSTAGRAM follow .widget_container .widget_basic YOUTUBE ---------YOUTUBE follow .widget_container .widget_basic #widget_region_right_sidebar .grid_3 © 2019 Two Cats Music.
