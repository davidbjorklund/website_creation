Everyone was so friendly and keen to help the kids adjust - just great!  There seems to have been just the right mix of music and social to keep the kids happy. John and the rest of the wonderful CYMC faculty -  thank you for sharing your gift of music and for inspiring Cait and all of us on her music journey. -Theresa Under the leadership of Lori, Lindsay, Shannon, Shari, Sheri and countless others, Thoroughly Modern Millie was a phenomenal experience for Maia. Everything that is so difficult to achieve abroad was in abundance and then some, at CYMC. Two weeks after Millie wrapped up, Maia stopped in New York on the way back to Dubai to attend an audition-only one-week dance program at Pace University. According to Maia it was fine, but couldn't possibly compare to the amazing experience she had at CYMC. -Allison and Maia PROUD TO PARTNER WITH 204-580 Duncan Avenue, Courtenay, BC V9N-2M7 | 250-338-7463 | info@cymc.ca | Website Designed and Developed by Medium Rare Interactive
