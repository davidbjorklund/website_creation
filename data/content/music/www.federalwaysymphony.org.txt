Tickets & Support Link your Amazon Smile account Make a Donation In the Community A Message from Maestro Davenport Our intention with the Federal Way Symphony is to bring great music from all eras and traditions to our audience.  Our community is diverse and we reach out with ‘something for everyone.’ Our guiding principle is to present great music in all its forms, and we are proud to contribute to the cultural life in Federal Way, helping make this a great community to live in.  About the Symphony Masters and Mentors The Masters and Mentors program pairs music educators with students who would otherwise be unable to afford individual music instruction, helping them to hone their technique, refine their sound, and prepare for auditions and ensemble playing. Students “pay” for the lessons through mentoring another younger student, fostering a culture of philanthropy.   Find out more Raise the Baton Federal Way Symphony has set a goal of getting 1,000 community members to help us “Raise the Baton” this season.
