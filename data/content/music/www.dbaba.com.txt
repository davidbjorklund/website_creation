home/index dbaba.com Gigs links Darius Babazadeh started playing the bassoon at the age of ten when, after telling his mother he wanted to play trumpet or drums, she brought home the bassoon for him to learn. In high school, he took up the saxophone in order to play in the marching band while continuing to play bassoon in the symphonic band. Taking lessons from local sax legend Mike Butera, he was exposed to and influenced by Charlie Parker, John Coltrane, Tom Scott and Stanley Turrentine. However, it was his talent on the bassoon for which he was awarded a scholarship to California State University at Northridge where he studied under the instruction of Walt Ritchie, principal bassoonist for the Los Angeles Philharmonic. He furthered his education on the bassoon with Dr.Susan Willoughby at California State University, Sacramento. Yet he could not deny his main passion was for jazz and the sax. For the next twenty-five years, Darius played the tenor sax, flute and clarinet while touring with Paul Anka throughout North and South America, Europe and Asia. Darius has also worked with Johnny Mathis, Natalie Cole, The Temptations, Xavier Cugat, and Lynyrd Skynyrd. After short stints living in Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York, he returned home to Sacramento to form his band, the dbaba project, which can be found performing in different venues throughout the region. His CD Endless Stars, featuring Scott Collard (piano), Melissa Collard (voice), Rick Lotter (drums) and Svetozar Necak (bass), can be heard locally on KXPR.
