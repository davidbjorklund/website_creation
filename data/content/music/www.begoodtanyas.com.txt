Read a few words from Beat Syndrome and stream the tracks below. I am a huge fan of The be Good Tanyas and their music. After hearing " Waitin' Round to Die " for the first time I knew I had to try and do a remix for it. The music and the lyrics inspired me to make a darker version which was slightly slower than the original tempo. Waitin' Round to Die " Horses " has been one of my favorite songs from BGT for a long time. There are many great elements to the track and I am very happy that I was able to bring a more "theatrical" theme to it with my mix. I hope all you BGT fans enjoy the remixes. Many thanks to Sam Parton, The Be Good Tanyas and the crew for their support.
