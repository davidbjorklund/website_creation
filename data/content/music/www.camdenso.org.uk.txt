We have been a mainstay of musical life in north London for nearly forty years with around seventy regular players. Under our Musical Director Levon Parikian, CSO seeks to combine the familiar staples of the classical and romantic repertoire with less well-known and more challenging works. We rehearse on a weekly basis and perform three major orchestral concerts a year. Recent concert programmes have included a Family Concert featuring Britten's  The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra , symphonies by Brahms and Mahler, piano concertos by Rachmaninov and Shostakovich, the violin concertos of Elgar and Korngold, Arutiunian's Trumpet Concerto , Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition , Saint-Saëns' 'Organ Symphony' and a concert dedicated to film music in 'A Night at the Movies' . In July 2016 we performed Laura Rossi's score for  The Battle of the Somme  accompanying a screening of the 1916 IWM film as part of the Somme100 Film Project. The orchestra has performed a number of operas, and a wide range of choral works including Brahms' Ein Deutsches Requiem , Handel's  Coronation Anthems, Haydn's The Creation  and Mozart's  Requiem . We look forward to seeing you at our next concert , and we're always pleased to hear from instrumentalists keen to play with us .
