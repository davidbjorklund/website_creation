Owen Daly, Maker of Early Keyboard Instruments      About My Work Gallery Prices (2018) Contact Two-manual harpsichord completed in May 2013, after one attributed to Claude Labreche, last quarter of the 17th century. Labreche worked in Carpentras, near Avignon, at that time in the Papal States, not France, so it is not, strictly speaking, a "French" harpsichord. Detailed photo collections of these recent projects are available on Flikr. Click on any to view its set: Neapolitan Harpsichord c.1550 Single-Manual Harpsichord after Michael Mietke, Berlin 1710 Fretted Clavichord After Manuel de Sousa Carneiro Senior, Oporto 1796 Double-Manual Harpsichord after Christian Zell, Hamburg, 1728   This harpsichord reflects earlier practices in that the 4' is on the upper manual and voiced as a solo stop. Because the two manuals are not coupled, this allows a wide range of unusual effects with contrasts between the two manuals. It is, essentially, a single-manual harpsichord, with a second, octave, instrument superimposed above. Compass GG, AA (no GG#) - c'''. Case of Oregon "claro" walnut, with framing of very old pine; soundboard of true fir (abies nobilis). Voiced with real quill, and strung in historical iron wire based upon studies of surviving wire samples.   OWEN DALY EARLY KEYBOARD INSTRUMENTS 557 Statesman Street NE Salem, OR 97301 (503) 362-9396 Original Web Design by owendaly.com
