We also have hats and t-shirts for sale as well... Click here to visit my Gift Shop . Of course, you can still order the Songs The Jukebox Taught Me Volume 1 and Volume 2 CDs and digital downloads from Heart of Texas Records , Amazon , iTunes and Spotify . This collection of classic songs is a tribute to the songwriters who crafted them, and the artists who sang them  the heroes and teachers who taught us all this music. Be sure to check out what's happening on my tour schedule page, and come on down to the Continental Club in Austin (by God!) Texas on Sunday nights and get ready to dance your tail off from 7 to 10 p.m.! The tradition has continued for 18 years and counting with the country band Heybale featuring Redd Volkaert, Earl Poole Ball, Tom Lewis, Kevin Smith ... and yours truly. When I'm not picking with the guys, join me on SiriusXM Radio -- weekdays from noon to 6 p.m. and Sunday from 10 a.m. to noon Eastern at Willies Roadhouse channel 59, and Tuesday through Friday in Outlaw Country channel 60 from 10 a.m. to noon Eastern. It's been a great couple of years with a number of live and recorded performances, including four appearances on the Grand Ole Opry , the Ernest Tubb Midnite Jamboree , Country's Family Reunion and Larry's Country Diner on RFD TV. Thanks to all my friends in radio for their support of my music. And special thanks to the Texas Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum for inducting me into the Disc Jockey Hall of Fame. What an amazing honor!
