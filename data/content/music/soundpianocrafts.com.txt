We check the Pedals, Action, Cabinet & Tone with every scheduled Tuning visit." - Phil Glenn, RPT, owner of Sound Piano Crafts .   CONTACT US SCHEDULE TUNING SERVICES: For consistency of pitch Your piano is an extraordinary instrument which can bring you and your family a lifetime of enjoyment. The basic standard of care recommended by most piano manufacturers and technicians is to tune your piano every 6 months to a year. Pianos that are played often or used for performances may require more frequent tuning, perhaps at each seasonal change, after a move, or before an important event. CONTACT US ACTION REGULATING: For consistency of touch Thousands of finely engineered and crafted moving parts make up the piano action. They are responsible for the way a pianoâs keys trigger the hammers to strike the strings and respond to the hands of the pianist. Over time and due to various conditions, responsiveness can waver, with one or more keys on the piano growing out of sync with the others. Regulation is the mechanical adjustment.  CONTACT US PIANO VOICING: For Consistency of Tone The musical tone quality, or "voice" of each piano note is ideally designed to provide an even and wide range of tone, from soft and sweet to loud and bright. Over time, some of the keys may develop a differing quality of tone - whether "darker," "brighter" or otherwise. Many factors can affect the sound you hear. Voicing is the adjustment of a piano's tone or quality of sound. CONTACT US PIANO FINISH CARE:  For consistency of beauty The piano is unique among musical instruments because it also serves as fine furniture for the home. Pianos are finished with a variety of materials, each requiring a different cleaning method. Learning proper maintenance techniques will enhance its beauty and preserve the value of your piano. However, some exposed parts inside your piano are fragile, so it's best to let us clean these areas. CONTACT US RECONDITIONING Reconditioning is the process of putting a piano back in good condition by cleaning, repairing, and adjusting for best performance with parts replacement only where necessary. Reconditioning is designed to improve a piano's performance, keeping in mind both costs and benefits. REBUILDING Rebuilding involves complete disassembly, inspection, and repair as necessary, including replacement of worn, damaged, or deteriorated parts. This could include the soundboard, bridges, pinblock, and strings -- as well as the action, trapwork, keyboard, and plate and case refinishing. Rebuilding restores the piano to original condition or better. REFINISHING Your piano's cabinet, like all woodwork, is subject to damage or wear with age and humidity changes. Sunlight will also age the finish prematurely and cause color fading. We have a complete refinishing shop and have beautifully finished thousands of instruments, from fine antiques and heirlooms to modern grands and uprights. We can customize a finish to fit any taste or style. REDESIGN Many believe that the âGolden Ageâ of piano making was back in the early 20th Century. Even so, modern materials and equipment now allow us to rethink some of those old designs and make changes that can vastly enhance their performance. Also, many newer pianos can be improved with current techniques or with the use of boutique crafted parts that were not available, until now.
