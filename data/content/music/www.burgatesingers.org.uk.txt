BURGATE SINGERS The Burgate Singers, one of Suffolks leading amateur choirs. BURGATE SINGERS - A CHOIR BASED IN NORFOLK AND SUFFOLK THE BURGATE SINGERS One of Suffolks leading amateur choirs, t he Burgate Singers are based on the Norfolk Suffolk border not far from Diss. Our repertoire is exciting and wide-ranging and includes choral classics such as Mozarts Requiem, Handels Messiah and Bachs Magnificat, as well as twentieth century music like Rachmaninovs Vespers and works by Stravinsky. We perform mainly in local churches and the Diss Corn Hall. We have also performed in London. There are usually about 30 choir members, and we welcome new singers. We are friendly and fun, but we aim for high standards under musical director, Alain Judd. Moreover, we perform with professional orchestras and soloists. The Burgate Singers generally stage two concerts a year. We rehearse on Sunday afternoons at 4pm at Burgate Church Hall. Auditions are not necessary  we are happy for you to come along and see how you get on. We also organise occasional singing workshops aimed at getting the best out of your voice. We are available to sing at weddings (see our Contact Us page). A ffiliated to Making Music, The Burgate Singers is a registered charity (No. 1092675).
