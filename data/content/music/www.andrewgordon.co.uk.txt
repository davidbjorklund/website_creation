ï»¿ Andrew Gordon Scottish Folk Singer Site designed and maintained by Andrew Gordon Scottish Folk Music (C) 2005 contact - enquiries@andrewgordon.co.uk Andrew Gordon was born in 1976, in Fort William on the West Coast of Scotland. He has been performing for over 20 years and has played all over Scotland, as well as Europe and North America. He plays a wide range of traditional songs, as well as some slightly more modern folk music, accompanied by guitar and bodhran. Andrew loves putting on a show and no matter if it is to 10 or 1000 he gives it his all while on stage. If you would like some traditional music for your event please have a look at our bookings page.
