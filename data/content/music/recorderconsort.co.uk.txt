Our repertoire ranges from Early Music to contemporary composers encompassing a wide range of musical styles. The members are local amateur musicians who aim to perform to a high standard whilst enjoying a friendly, social group. Seven different recorders are currently used. The smallest is the tiny Garklein, descending in pitch and growing in size are the Sopranino, Descant, Treble, Tenor, Bass and Great Bass. In addition to recorders, the group features a variety of contemporary and period instruments in their interpretation of early music. Voice, percussion, traditional folk instruments and improvisation all combine to give the BRC a unique style.
