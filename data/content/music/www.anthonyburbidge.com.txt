Yes! “Us And Them” has won the 2016 emPower Music & Arts Positive Music Video Award! I’d like to say a very BIG thank-you to everyone who took time to vote last month. And thanks also to the many people who tried to vote but were unsuccessful in navigating the tricky waters of the voting process. What’s next? Now that the video has won the award – PLEASE share the good news but, more importantly, please share the video. With all the crazy stuff happening in the world right now, humanity needs the message of this song. Awards are wonderful but inspiring humankind to rise above false divisions is what’s really important. New CD coming in 2017! As a result of the positive feedback received from so many at the Unity of Canada National Conference, I’m in the process of creating my first CD of songs since 2008. The selections have been hand picked as some of the most requested songs at Unity Of Calgary and at this year’s National Conference. Bed tracks, lead vocals, harmonies and choirs have been recorded and solo instruments will soon be done as well. New site design underway anthonyburbidge.com is undergoing a face lift. When the process is complete, the site will have a fresh look, lots of new content and offerings to serve both fans and spiritual communities. Stay tuned for updates in 2017.
