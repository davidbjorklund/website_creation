Our Company Read Rave Reviews from our Highly Satisfied Customers We Love Good Vibrations “Greg, I just wanted you to know that my daughter Stephanie’s Sweet 16 was the best! I couldn’t have asked for a better DJ or MC. Sal and Eddie kept the party rockin’ all night long. The kids were all dancing the interaction between the kids and the MC was great. I will book your company for my next party, no questions asked. Thanks for helping to make her Sweet 16 a night to remember.” — Lisa L.

Read More Long Island DJ that performs hundreds of events annually Find out how it all started The company was started by Greg M. Legakis, in 1988. When Greg graduated Indiana State University in 1982 with a B.A. Degree in Psychology, he was interested in pursuing a career in advertising. After moving up to a Chicago suburb, Greg stumbled on a job at a 50’s and 60’s Nightclub called Studebakers. This was his first formal plunge into the world of deejaying. In 1999 Greg adopted the name Good Vibrations D.J. Entertainment full time. To this day Good Vibrations is a full time business that performs hundreds of events annually.
