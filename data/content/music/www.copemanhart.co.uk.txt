They are of the highest tonal quality when compared with other digital organs that I have presided at. “I have played, and continue to play, the finest of pipe organs, which meant that I was always somewhat of a critic but, in my opinion, no other substitute would ever compare to this marvellous organ, right down to the very console finish and key touch. To me, it sounds like the real thing without the pipes. Copeman Hart - I applaud you!” Read more Church of St Thérèse, Banbridge, Ireland Colum McGarry, organist “The instrument is inspiring to play.” Read more St Mary's Parish Church, Barnard Castle, United Kingdom Joan Johnson , Organist “Copeman Hart's attention to detail and commitment to the project was exceptional.
