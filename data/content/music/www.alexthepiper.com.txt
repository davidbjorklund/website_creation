I am available to play at weddings, Burns Nights and many other events, endeavouring to add some musical excitement to any celebration. Wearing the full Highland dress, I will add a sense of occasion to your event, as well as some excellent music. Traditional and contemporary Scottish music I play a mixture of traditional and contemporary Scottish music, and can offer a range of unique services for your event. As well as playing the Highland pipes, I also play the Scottish small pipes, border pipes and whistles, and can provide you with background music during a meal or reception. I also play with Ã’r Ceilidh Band, and can arrange a full ceilidh dance for you as the evenings entertainment. I am available to play throughout Scotland, and am more than happy to travel further afield for special events. If you would like me to come and play for you please get in touch and I will do my best to make sure that your event is as enjoyable and memorable as possible. Make contact about me Since moving to Edinburgh I have become involved in several musical projects. I founded Ã’r Ceilidh Band a few years ago, and we have since played throughout Scotland, and as far afield as Germany, Qatar and Beijing.Â More recently, I have formed the band Awry.
