This site is dedicated to fretless basses (acoustic and uprights welcome too!). Originally designed as a user submitted gallery of fretless basses, our site now includes much more, including exclusive interviews and articles, featured songs and videos, a shopping area, and community links for those who play or simply admire fretless basses. FretlessBass.com was originally launched in 2000 and within the first year became a top ten search engine result for fretless basses. The user submitted gallery has grown from one bass to over five hundred, and it is still growing. From players that only have a single, memorable fretless performance, to those who use the instrument exclusively as their voice, and even those who bring upright bass into the mainstream or cross over genres; we consider them all relevant, unique, and worthy of discovering. We plan to continually add content related to fretless basses to make this the ultimate resource for this beautiful and timeless instrument.
