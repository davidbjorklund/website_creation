Since 1957, the Waukesha based band El Rey and the Night Beats have been playing rock n roll for a generation of teens (now just a bit older). So many can vividly remember dancing to "El Rey" at the VFW, or Eagle's Club in Waukesha, Teen Haven in Sussex, Muskego Beach, Marty Zivkos, Papa Joes, Whistling Toad, Sunset Bowl, Fox View and many Olde Car Club dances. So many grew up with the band and it's music. It's all part of the memories we have of those more carefree "good ol' days". Like our lives, times change and members have come and gone, but what made the band unique has been it's longevity. Now, more than 50 years later, the old rock n roll bug has bitten them again and many of the original band members are back together, playing the same songs as they played the first time around. This is not one of those 60's revival bands with one or two original guys... These are many of the same group that played together in the 60's, 70's and 80's. If you want to take a trip back in time, be sure to catch "El Rey and the (almost original) Night Beats!" They will be performing on a limited basis, so don't miss any of their performances. They hope to see your familiar faces again, for dancing and music just like it used to be. Â  St. John Nuemann (Waukesha) Church Festival, 2011 Memorable...
