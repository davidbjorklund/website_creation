You were so well organised and totally took the pressure off us, everyone enjoyed the ceilidh, the music was a great mix, the caller judged the ability of everyone there perfectly, and feedback from all the guests couldn't have been more positive. Couldn't have wished for a better experience, and we were really lucky to find you." More comments Sarah, Jacqy, Fergus, Mannie - Sidmouth Folkweek Sarah, Alex, Mannie & Fergus "Focused and accomplished, this is dignified Anglo Celtic music of the first order" fROOTS "This lovely album" Irish Music magazine "Every tune played becomes a real delight and the biggest surprise is that the band is little known" Keltika (Italy) "inexplicably undersung...Present-day bands playing Celtic repertoire donât come much better than this." Netrhythms "The music produced is quite exhilarating and a toe-tapping certainty." Fiddle On "Extremely accomplished."
