In another university study, children who took music lessons for only six months scored a whopping 34% higher in abstract-reasoning skills than a second group that studied the computer. Problem solving skills improve because learning music integrates sequencing, memorization, patterning and, especially, creative thinking. Fact: Music majors are the most likely group of college grads to be admitted to medical school. Physician and biologist Lewis Thomas studied the undergraduate majors of medical school applicants. He found that 66 percent of music majors who applied to med school were admitted, the highest percentage of any group. For comparison, 44 percent of biochemistry majors were admitted. Also, a study of 7,500 university students revealed that music majors scored the highest reading scores among all majors including English, biology, chemistry and math. Fact: Musical ability increases one's confidence and overall sense of self worth: Secondary students who participate in music programs report the lowest lifetime and current use of all substances, such as alcohol, tobacco, and drugs. - Texas Commission on Drug and Alcohol Abuse Report. Reported in Houston Chronicle, January 1998, cited by The National Association for Music Education, http://www.menc.org/information/advocate/facts.html Fact: Studies have shown that kids who study music perform higher on standardized tests, have a higher than average rate of admittance to college, and are more likely to go on to higher education. Learning to play an instrument will directly affect a child's reading comprehension, math, and logic skills. The United States Department of Education stated that "Many colleges view participation in the arts and music as a valuable experience that broadens students' understanding and appreciation of the world around them. It is also well known and widely recognized that the arts contribute significantly to children's intellectual development." - Getting Ready for College Early: A Handbook for Parents of Students in the Middle and Junior High School Years, U.S. Department of Education, 1997 Fact: The very best engineers and technical designers in the Silicon Valley industry are, nearly without exception, practicing musicians. - Grant Venerable, "The Paradox of the Silicon Savior," as reported in "The Case for Sequential Music Education in the Core Curriculum of the Public Schools," The Center for the Arts in the Basic Curriculum, New York, 1989 Fact: Music making makes the elderly healthier. There were significant decreases in anxiety, depression, and loneliness following keyboard lessons. These are factors that are critical in coping with stress, stimulating the immune system, and in improved health. Results also show significant increases in human growth hormones following the same group keyboard lessons. (Human growth hormone is implicated in aches and pains.) - Dr. Frederick Tims, reported in AMC Music News, June 2, 1999. Fact: A grade eight RCM certificate qualifies one to become a teacher, a grade 7 certificate is worth one arts credit in high school grade 11, and a grade 8 certificate is worth one arts credit for grade 12.Â  </hs:element49> <hs:element53> </hs:element53> <hs:element54> Music Lessons , Practice Tip of the Week July 15, 2019 While you were practicing the hard parts of your music, you may have become tense or frustrated, or forgotten to sing or play musically or with good tone quality or technique. End your practice time by playing or singing something you like that is easy for you. Relax and "perform" it for yourself, playing with your very best technique and musicianship. During this part of your practices, develop a "repertoire" of music that you feel very comfortable and confident playing or singing. Then you'll always have something ready if people ask for a performance.Â  At " A Sharp" School of Music, Etobicoke Â (WestÂ  Toronto ) we offerÂ  private or group music lessons Â in: Piano, Keyboard, Voice/Vocal/Singing/Public Speaking, Guitar, Bass Guitar, Mandolin, Banjo, Ukulele, Drums, Violin, Fiddle, Flute, Piccolo, Saxophone, Trumpet, Clarinet, Theory, Rock Band School, Glee Club and a Pre-School Program for children aged 3 to 5 There are no registration fees WeÂ are entirely exempt from sales tax :) Call now to book a free introductory lesson: 416-614-PLAY (7529) or 416-614-SING (7464) ~ Established 1998 ~ </hs:element54> <hs:element69> </hs:element69> <hs:element70> </hs:element70> <hs:element71> </hs:element71> <hs:element88> </hs:element88> <hs:element72> </hs:element72> <hs:element73> </hs:element73> <hs:element97> </hs:element97> <hs:element75> </hs:element75> <hs:element44> </hs:element44> <hs:element76> </hs:element76> <hs:element77> </hs:element77> <hs:element78> </hs:element78> <hs:element84> </hs:element84> <hs:element89> </hs:element89> <hs:element91> </hs:element91> <hs:element94> </hs:element94> <hs:element87> Music Lessons for all ages </hs:element87> <hs:element104> </hs:element104> <hs:element111> </hs:element111> <hs:element112> </hs:element112> <hs:element113> </hs:element113> <hs:element114> </hs:element114> <hs:element126> </hs:element126> <hs:element124> Complimentary Wi-Fi :) </hs:element124> <hs:element125> </hs:element125> <hs:element147> </hs:element147> <hs:element148> </hs:element148> <hs:element149> </hs:element149> <hs:element150> </hs:element150> <hs:element153> </hs:element153> <hs:element154> </hs:element154> <hs:element155> *Yes!Â  We Offer Online Â Lessons Via Skype! </hs:element155> <hs:element158> Student Appreciation Day!!!Â Â  </hs:element158> <hs:element160> </hs:element160> <hs:element183> Next Student Recital:Â A Sharp Christmas RecitalÂ - Sunday December 8, 2019 </hs:element183> <hs:element210> </hs:element210> <hs:element213> ~ Your Gold and Platinum Winner of the Guardian Reader's Choice Awards ~ </hs:element213> <hs:googleanalytics> </hs:googleanalytics>
