New AHJ Editors Announced For the last several months, the American Harp Society, Inc. has been conducting a search for editorship of The American Harp Journal. We are pleased to announce the outcome for this critical position. A publication's editor is its creative and production leader. In the case of The American Harp Journal, we required an editor with extensive and broad experience with the harp, while at the same time possessing editorial expertise and publication experience. Following prolonged and rigorous search committee discussions, AHS administration ultimately chose a new path for staffing this critical leadership position. A solution emerged to have two candidates, each being a specialist in her own right, steeped in relevant experience, education, and focused passion in her respective domain. This innovative solution - to engage an Executive Editor and an Associate Editor* - is expected to bring our Journal the very best expertise of both candidates. Leslie Shortlidge has been named Executive Editor & Production Manager, and Emily Laurance is the new Associate Editor. Learn more about them by following the "More info . . . " link. More Info... Hurricane News & Anderson Insurance Our thoughts are with our members in both Texas and across Florida and beyond who have been through two severe hurricanes. Please be in touch if AHS can be of any assistance. Also please be aware that Anderson Insurance, located mid-state in Sebring, FL, sustained damage and only regained power on Friday. Please be patient if you have a claim or are awaiting a quote. They are backed up from being closed for several days, but are working through needs and will respond as quickly as possible. Please let us know on social media how you fared through the storm, and any assistance you may need from AHS and your harpist colleagues. More Info...
