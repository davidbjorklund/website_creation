Play what you love and saturate the world with it.” Chick Corea “Crosara’s compositions are considerate of their audience, providing a source of joy, comfort, escape, and healing. Crosara believes jazz is a collective experience and a “living language” that distills a multitude of identities, backgrounds, and personalities.” Earshot Jazz “A pianist who originally hails from Italy, Crosara is well-versed in bop lore, and his delicate flow might indicate a debt to Bill Evans.” Down Beat Magazine “the kind of sensitive swing seldom heard since Bill Evans. Crosara’s rubato meanderings are precious insights into his fertile imagination and harmonic daring.” Jazz Times Magazine “The piano echoes notes like twinkling stars, beauty surrounded by silence. […] You’ll dance through your tears and love the loneliness, I did.” Jazz Improv Magazine “Francesco Crosara proves he is a pianist with expert chops and broad interests. […] Crosara has an awareness of world music but a firm grounding in the modern jazz vernacular. His major piano influences are unsurprising: Herbie Hancock and Chick Corea. Like them, he has an interest in electric as well as acoustic jazz.” All About Jazz “Francesco Crosara has been a world traveler in both his life and his music. He is a strikingly original pianist who displays his own inventive style while reviving standards and debuting new suites.” Scott Yanow end of row end of container QUOTES & REVIEWS end of row “Francesco, your music is wonderful – always has been.
