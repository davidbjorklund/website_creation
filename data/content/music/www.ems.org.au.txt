The Club runs an orchestra, a choir, a symphonic wind ensemble and two stage bands, as well as providing performance opportunities for a variety of small ensemble groups. Whilst we are affiliated with the University of Melbourne Student Union (UMSU) and the Engineering Faculty, the club is open for anyone, student or not, and of any musical background to join. Constitutionally we do not have auditions for members to join any of the ensembles, and we strive to foster an inclusive atmosphere within our club community.  Interested in joining? We're always keen to welcome new members to any of our ensembles, or even just to our social events. Have a look around our site for an idea of what we do, and what sorts of things you might like to join in with!
