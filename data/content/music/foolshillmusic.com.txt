It's a collection of twelve original songs including a country ballad, "In Lieu Of Flowers," a poignant look at family with the folky "Family Recipe," a bit of fingerpicking whimsy with "That's Why Republicans Hate Trains," and a waltz-time look at European café society between the wars with "When Words Still Mattered." Ably assisted by many talented musicians including Peter Ostroushko (mandolin), Tony Markellis (bass), Teresina Huxtable (reed organ, accordion, vocals), Tom Wieseler (keyboards), Danny Whelchel (drums and percussion), Kevin Maul (pedal steel & dobro), Nick Piccininni (fiddle), Orion Kribs (mandolin), John Kribs (electric guitar) and Don Armstrong, Liz Hood and Carol Christensen (harmonies). Greg Montgomery and Paula Rosenberg handled the album graphics. We will celebrate the release with a concert Saturday, December 29th at Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs, NY. -- MJ, 9/13/2018 Welcome Welcome to Fool's Hill Music, the moniker that covers my little recording studio, publishing company (ASCAP), record label and now the latest addition to my mostly imaginary business empire, the Fool's Hill Music Record Store. If you are interested in recording at Fool's Hill Studio (there is no hill and it is in my home; I guess that just leaves the fool) please feel free to contact me at mj@michaeljerling.com . We can then chat in person or on the phone and see if this is the right place for you. I only take on a limited number of projects. I do a lot of acoustic and singer songwriter projects and have the ability to take my studio on the road if that is what you need. I can supply the names of past clients to get the real dirt on me. If you are a speed metal guitarist, rapper, or the next big thing in a cowboy hat, move along little doggie. I'm truly excited about the Fool's Hill Music Record Store. I have worked with so many talented musicians throughout my performing career and in my studio, and it is my goal, in a modest way, to make their music available to more listeners. My model is the now mostly extinct small town record store, where the owner had definite opinions about what was good, who you should listen to, and didn't carry crap. Probably why they are mostly extinct. OK, I have an overactive imagination, but that is why I'm a songwriter and not a Certified Public Accountant. C.P.A's with overactive imaginations wind up in jail. Please browse through the store (don't spill coffee on the merchandise) and maybe take a chance on something that sounds intriguing. I think you will be pleasantly surprised.

The result was be a CD called "Music Here Tonight" which debuted on Friday, September 25th at the old coffeehouse on Phila Street. I was joined onstage by Tony Markellis and Teresina Huxtable and cheered on by a group of patient and enthusiastic friends and fans. Though recording live was nerve wracking, we did manage to have some fun, and I am very pleased by the musical result. The CD features 18 songs spanning my nearly forty years of writing and performing. Many of the tunes were by requested by folks on my email list, and there is one new song, the title cut, "Music Here Tonight". -- MJ, 09/07/2009, updated for tense Ray Lambiase - Kid Bayonne Our newest release is Ray's late 2018 album, "Kid Bayonne."
