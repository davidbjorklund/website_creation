We will not be reordering Lindy Fralin Pickups when our current stock is depleted. The cryogenic company we used has gone out of business, so we will not be able to treat pickups like we have done in the past. So if you like our custom wound pickups Fralin produced for us, the stock that is remaining will be the final production run. UPDATE ... We have depleted our Fralin Pickups.
