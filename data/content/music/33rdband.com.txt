Like the original band, the musicians were recruited from the same geographical area in Illinois and come from all walks of life. The band is an authentic re-creation of the actual Civil War Era band that was mustered at State Normal University in 1861. The 33rd Illinois Volunteer Regiment Band has performed for historic programs, school events, and civic events throughout the Midwest, including many performances in Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Missouri, Ohio, Kentucky, and Wisconsin. The band also plays at military balls and conducts educational programs that address the history of the Civil War era brass band movements and the evolution of brass instruments. The band's uniforms, sewn from natural wool fibers, are authentic in every detail and are patterned from actual specimens worn by the Union soldier. The authenticity in dress presents the audience with the most accurate appearance possible.
