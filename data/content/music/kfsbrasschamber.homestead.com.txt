Outside Texas, I'd prefer you to coordinate with your surrounding schools and arrange a tour of those schools. There is no charge to your school for these sessions. I will make my music available at the sessions for purchase. Sound files will be available as well. </hs:element17> <hs:element19> Click here to see a highlight from a recent session </hs:element19> <hs:element20> New Option With Every Solo Order!! Instant Accompanist Â  With every solo order, if you would like a soundfile of the accompanying line to download, indicate so in your email or print order. This can be helpful if an accompanist isn't available for every rehearsal. </hs:element20> <hs:element23> Commission Projects It is my distinct pleasure to fulfill commissions from individuals or groups. I have completed both small and large scale projects for commissioners worldwide. If you glance through some titles on this site, you will find those commissioners recognized.
