The âNaturalâ in Lara Natural Music refers simply to my love of music made by people in a natural way, rather than by machines. It is the antithesis of modern computer generated pop music, which I find cynical and boring. My music encompasses various styles and influences. If I had to choose one description it would be folk music, but then Louis Armstrong once said âAll music is folk musicâ. I think that is unarguable, given his further observation that he had never heard a horse sing a song. Categorisation is ultimately pointless, particularly as we no longer have record stores. Duke Ellington once said âThere are only two kinds of music; good music, and the other kindâ. Whatever you want to call it, I hope my music falls into the former category.
