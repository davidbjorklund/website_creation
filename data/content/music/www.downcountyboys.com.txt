About the Band. First formed in 1964, the Down County Boys are the UK’s longest established Bluegrass Band. During that time there have been a total of thirty one musicians pass through the ranks, some staying for a long time and some, for just a short while. The longest reigning member, and captain of the “good ship DCB” being Peter Parker. Pete joined the band in 1969 and is still the leader of the Down County Boys to this day.  That is some achievement by anyone’s standards and I believe that we owe the success and the longevity of the band to the unswerving dedication, relentless hard work, and passion of one man, my good friend,  Peter Parker.”                                               Mick Cooper.
