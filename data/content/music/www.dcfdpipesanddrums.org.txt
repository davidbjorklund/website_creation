He was the Bands longtime photographer and could always be found  marching out front taking countless pictures.  He was a great friend and supporter of the Band and was awarded our Espirit de Corps award for his dedication, commitment, and service to the Band. He will be sorely missed, especially on Band trips.  ​Rest in Peace Tommy!

See you at practice. ​ Rest in Peace Jimmy Seavey Sr. 9/4/2018   The Band is saddened today by the passing of one of our own.   ​Retired Captain James Seavey Sr. passed away this morning at his home after a long and hard-fought battle with cancer.  “Jimmy”, as we all called him was the Band’s first appointed Honor Guard Sergeant.   Jimmy took on the task of maintaining our flags and equipment needed for the honor guard.   Our honor guard plays a very important role to the band as it represents our band motto, “Onóir, Meòraich, Beatha, Greadhan” which is Irish Gaelic for "Honor, Remember, Represent, Celebrate".   Jimmy was with the band as it formed back in 2002, lending any kind of support needed.  He helped arrange places to practice and whatever behind the scene task needed to be done during an event.  Like everything Jimmy had his hands on, he was ALL-IN.  Captain Seavey was a legend on the job as well.  He mentored everyone who came across his eyes with such a genuine attention to detail.  He spent his off days contributing countless hours to Cabin John Park VFD, Maryland State Fireman’s Assoc, Montgomery Co. Fire,  International Fire Chiefs, the list just goes on.  We could never sum up how much Jimmy Seavey will be missed in a single post.  He touched thousands of lives and we are grateful for his friendship and dedication to the band.    Rest Easy Captain James Seavey Sr.   We've got the watch. <<Previous bid: $blog_id Coming Events TBA ​ Tweets by @DCFD_PipesDrums Archives May 2019 March 2019 February 2019 December 2018 September 2018 August 2018 June 2018 April 2018 March 2018 February 2018 December 2017 October 2017 September 2017 June 2017 May 2017 April 2017 March 2017 February 2017 January 2017 December 2016 September 2016 August 2016 July 2016 June 2016 May 2016 April 2016 March 2016 February 2016 November 2015 October 2015 September 2015 end container CD Also Available on iTunes Follow us: Site Proudly Maintained by:  DCFD Emerald Society Pipes & Drums end container end footer-wrap Home About Us Band Roster Members Gallery Videos Contact Donate Store Book The Band
