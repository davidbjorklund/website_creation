We are proud to supply most of the largest guitar companies, world-wide. Our tops are found on the most prestigious of guitar brands. We produce the finest quality acoustic "tops" for western size (steel-string) guitars and classical guitars. We also produce limited quantities of guitar bracing wood (spruce). Boards for mandolins, violins, archtop guitars, ukeleles, and small guitars are also available. Experience We manufacture more than 400,000 guitar soundboards every year - and this year we expect to approach 500,000. For 14 continuous years, we've been manufacturing solid guitar tops to traditional standards. Our methods capture the finest appearance and produce the highest quality of sound. We have a full-time log buyer on staff. Every log is carefully inspected before we buy it and bring it to our factory on Vancouver Island. Quality Quality is the goal in every stage of our operations. Meeting Your Needs: We are able to supply our customers with the quantities and grades of tops they need - at competitive prices - and on a schedule that meets their factory requirements. Acoustic Woods can provide your company with small quantities of tops as well as 20' and 40' container-size shipments. But this is not the whole story... The reality is that good timber is a diminishing resource, so you might want to consider stockpiling for the future.... Latest Every year, we have a booth at the NAMM Show and also at Music China (Shanghai) Our booth number at Namm will be 1013 in Hall E,, Shanghai dates and details are coming soon. We have launched a new site that now allows customers to select high grade acoustic soundboards at a very reasonable price. It's been a very long time since we sold any retail products. Glad to be back! even if it's only a fraction. numo component home page calendar Direct Access to the Finest Logs from BC Forests British Columbia, on the west coast of Canada, is home of the finest tonewoods - giant spruce and cedar trees. Our products bridge the gap between the beauty of these giants in the forests of western Canada and the beauty of the musical notes created by musicians who play the guitars. Acoustic Woods has developed excellent relationships with logging companies and Canadian indigenous people (First Nations) to try to ensure our supply is uninterrupted. We are unwavering in creating employment and adding value to the forest industry within British Columbia. We recognize that we are part of a much larger community, and we feel compelled to act responsibly. numo component home page summary InstanceEndEditable InstanceBeginEditable name="footer" Footer ================================================== #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/shared/footer.lbi" container-fluid/row-fluid wrapper code 3 column left footer Quick Links Home Page About Our Company Contact Us / Map Grading Retail Buying Guide Our Product Catalog Cool Videos Policies center footer Let's Get Social!
