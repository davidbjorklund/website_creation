Music is his passion and he is passionate about how it's perceived throughout his audience.  He plays many guitars, harmonica, and fiddle and when you hear him you will think there is a whole band, not just one person. This is accomplished by what is known as looping.  There is never a "backing track" to play along with, which is used by some other players out there. His vocals and music will reach the deepest part of you while it sets your senses alive. He plays sounds from the current popular, to classic rock, to Dave Matthews, to his own original compositions as he touches on just about any genre you may desire (he plays hundreds of songs).  Dave Hawkins is playing on the Western Shore and throughout the Eastern Shore from Kent Island to Ocean City to Rehobeth Beach/ Fenwick Island  to St. Michaels just about every weekend during the year.  A native of Easton, Md, Dave started playing in local bands which included the favorite Riff Raff. A sabbatical from public performance followed, and song writing began that ultimately culminated in two CD's, Two-Way Mirror and Timing both of which are usually available for sale at his gigs.  Six original tracks from those CD's are featured above. continues at upper right Dave performs his stunning vocals accompanied by music from his Taylor 312 guitar (and other Taylors), mixing in sounds from his Alvarez and his vintage 100 year old  fiddle.  The music ranges from originals to Dave Matthews, Led Zeppelin, Neil Young, CSN, Bare Naked Ladies, Stone Temple Pilots, The Police, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings, Willie Nelson, Roy Orbison, The Righteous Brothers and many more, performed in Dave's own eclectic and energetic style.  Booking: dave@davehawkinsmusic.com Thanks for visiting! <iframe width="560" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/YS7Hos4lq_c" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <iframe align=center width="420" height="315" src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/z5tYaqZzOok" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe> <br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+2>Sorry</font></font></font> <br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Words &amp; Music - Dave Hawkins</font></font></font> <br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1>Recorded At DelMarVa Life Studios - Salisbury, MD</font></font></font> <br><font face="Verdana"><font color="#FFFFFF"><font size=+1><b><a href="sorry-studio-mix-lentz.html">Click Here</a></b> To Listen To The Studio Mix Of Sorry</font></font></font></center> Check out this review we found on the internet of Dave and Sticks playing at Kentmorr/ Dirty Dave's Tiki Bar on Kent Island:  "Ok... one more crab house mystery solved.  Mate and I braved the Bay Bridge traffic (almost uneventfully) on a Labor Day weekend Sunday afternoon.  We like to live dangerously, don't we?    Sat down with a dozen large crabs ($48/doz. not bad at all for a major holiday weekend) and an order of Caprese Salad.  The tomatoes and basil were out of the garden perfection. After all this is the Eastern Sho'.  Mozzerella was pedestrian domestic stuff just like you would find in any grocery store. The dressing a very light olive oil brought it all together and made us forget about fancy imported mozzerella.  The cool, sweet Caprese was the absolute perfect foil for our spicy steaming hot crabs. The mate has often asked for sliced garden tomatoes (when available, Silver Queen corn when not) with her crabs, but this was a step above and beyond. So I have kicked up Kentmorr to 5 stars .  But wait!  Completely without our planning, "Dave & Sticks" came along and set up their band equipment right next to us on the outdoor crab deck and began to play. Two local guys, a guitar, a fiddle, and a set of  conga drums playing Dave Matthews/David Gray kinda music. What a nice surprise to top off our Sunday afternoon.  ...we ordered another Caprese salad and another pitcher of beer and enjoyed Dave & Sticks a while..."  the mystery solved was J.O.
