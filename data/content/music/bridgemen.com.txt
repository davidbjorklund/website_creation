The Bridgemen's competitive corps became a powerhouse program in the 1970's in local and national competitive circuits including Drum Corps International. In 1988 the competitive corps ceased operation. A passionate group of alumni sparked the idea of an alumni corps in the late 1990's. The Bridgemen Alumni Corps rewrote the standards of the alumni activity from 2005 to 2016. The board chose to end the Alumni Corps program in 2016 and reorganize as a performing arts organization for 2017 and beyond. Sign up for our newsletter .
