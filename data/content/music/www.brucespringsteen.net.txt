The film follows Javed (Viveik Kalra), a British teen of Pakistani descent, growing up in Luton, England in 1987. Javed's turbulent life amidst the racial and economic turmoil of the times is transformed when he is introduced to the music of Bruce Springsteen. /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "As a lifelong Bruce fan, I am delighted how this soundtrack takes you through the experience of watching my movie with Springsteen music complemented by the other tracks, including very personal tracks—from my dad's favorite song to a British Bhangra anthem," said writer-director-producer Chadha. "Growing up, Sarfraz and I could never have imagined a universe where all these songs would be on one soundtrack reflecting our lives." /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph Chadha directed "Blinded by the Light" from a screenplay by Manzoor, Chadha and Paul Mayeda Berges. Chadha, Jane Barclay and Jamal Daniel produced the film, with Tory Metzger, Renee Witt, Peter Touche, Stephen Spence, Hannah Leader, Tracy Nurse, and Berges serving as executive producers. "Blinded by the Light" is a New Line Cinema presentation, in association with Levantine Films and Ingenious Media. Slated for release on August 14, 2019, it will be distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph A breakout smash at this year's Sundance Film Festival, "Blinded by the Light" has been hailed by critics as "a delirious and romantic rock 'n' roll parable…[an] incandescent ode to the life force of pop music" (Variety) and "pure, ingenuous joy" (Entertainment Weekly). Collider called it, "One of the year's best films" while the New York Post said, "Guaranteed to make you feel better than any other film this year." Indiewire said "Glorious" while The Wrap observed it was "Damn near irresistible." /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph Blinded By The Light: Original Motion Picture Soundtrack - Track List Ode To Javed/Javed's Poem – A.R.

The “hauntingly brilliant” (USA Today) Western Stars also comes out of the gate as a cross-continental champion. The album, which Esquire calls “his best new work in a decade,” has been #1 at both iTunes’ and Amazon’s album charts in the United States. Springsteen’s 19th studio album debuted at #1 on the UK album chart, giving him 11 #1s there and placing him alongside David Bowie and the Rolling Stones as one of the Top 5 acts with the most #1 UK albums.  /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph WESTERN STARS QUOTES /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "Some of Springsteen’s most beguiling work ever...the sound dates back to Springsteen’s youth, and he channels it masterfully." - Rolling Stone /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "His best new work in a decade...some of the most charming material of the venerable star’s career." - Esquire /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "A gorgeous love letter to the idea of songs providing salvation...the sort of magic Springsteen specializes in conjuring." - Entertainment Weekly /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "A work representing an entirely new direction...an album steeped in myths, and yet, it also seeks to puncture them." – Wall Street Journal /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "Songs that thrive on the swells and undulations of orchestral drama...its gathering impact comes from its expansive arrangement, which opens and deepens around his voice like an endless prairie." - New York Times /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "It stands comparison with his very best solo albums” - The Telegraph /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "Nothing short of a late-period masterpiece... A must-have for anyone with a heart" - The Independent /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph "Springsteen’s long-distance road trip to bold new sonic horizons, steeped in tradition but strikingly distinct all the same" - The Sun /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph “Majestic in its scale, but traditional in its subject matter and narratives, ‘Western Stars’ is a wonderful thing" - NME /wp:paragraph Read More July 5, 2019 Nassau 12/31/1980 wp:paragraph For the first time, multi-track master tapes of the classic New Year’s Eve 1980 show have been transferred via Plangent Processes and newly remixed by Jon Altschiller for superior sound.

Spanning 35 songs, Nassau 12/29 beautifully blends deep  River  cuts (“Stolen Car,” “Wreck on the Highway,” “Point Blank”), seasonal nuggets (“Merry Christmas Baby” and “Santa Claus Is Coming to Town” and fan favorites (“Fire,” “Because the Night”), making it one of the finest shows of the tour.   /wp:paragraph June 14, 2019 ‘WESTERN STARS’ OUT TODAY wp:paragraph /wp:paragraph wp:paragraph Bruce Springsteen’s 19th studio album  Western Stars  is out today on Columbia Records.
