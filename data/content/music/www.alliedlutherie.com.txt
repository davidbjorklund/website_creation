Welcome to Allied Lutherie! We're a family business in our 40th year supplying the industry with guitar woods, parts and supplies for the guitar maker. From our base here in Healdsburg, California, we have traveled around the world procuring instrument quality woods, resawing, drying, sanding, sorting and grading them. And we've shipped these woods around the world, often back to the country they came from!  We offer a wide selection of tonewoods, many of which can be individually viewed and selected by our customers via our Weekly Special. We also offer what we're told is one of the the best truss rods in the industry, along with our own line of kerfing, both of which are made right here in our shop!  In addition, we offer very high quality bone for nuts and saddles, fingerboards, bridge blanks, headplates and much more.  If you don't see it, ask, because we often have wood and parts, which are not listed on our website. Thanks for your interest!   -Todd, Mary and Grant Taggart Contact Us Telephone: 707-431-3760 Address: 101 C Grant Avenue Healdsburg, CA 95448 USA Email: info@alliedlutherie.com Begin MailChimp Signup Form Subscribe to our mailing list Email Address real people should not fill this in and expect good things - do not remove this or risk form bot signups End mc_embed_signup Copyright © 2019, Allied Lutherie =MD Added this to include the lightbox plugin for use on Collection Pages This JS works by finding all the images on the page that aren’t displayed at their original size and then links them to their large version using the lightbox plugin Link: https://help.shopify.com/themes/customization/colors-images-and-video/add-lightbox-to-images Link: http://dimsemenov.com/plugins/magnific-popup/documentation.html =MD End Lightbox Edits
