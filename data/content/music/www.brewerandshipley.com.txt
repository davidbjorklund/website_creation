Brewer & Shipley's Top 10 hit " One Toke Over The Line " was largely responsible for introducing them to the masses, yet their music careers neither began nor ended with this one song.    more         ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ One Toke Tom - Tom's Stories   Michael Brewer to Oklahoma Music Hall of Fame 12/1 Oklahoma Hall of Fame Article   B&S Documentary to Premier in St. Louis 11/3   Michael with Steve Martin   Kama Sutra Albums on CD (2017)     NEW - After The Storm by Michael Brewer              A NEW song and video by Tom Shipley " Please Don't Send Me Home "     Free MP3 "Cimmaron River" Brewer & Shipley Private Events FAQs ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~       Like us on Facebook Home    /    Shows     /   Store    /   Albums    /   Songs    /   Bios   /   Photos    /   Contacts    /   ETC Copyright 2018 Michael Brewer & Tom Shipley.  All Rights Reserved.  Unauthorized use prohibited msnavigation msnavigation msnavigation   msnavigation
