Auditions are happening now for our 24th Season of presenting Music that Moves the Soul! If you are a singer and would like to audition, we invite you to go to the AUDITION page and fill out an application! Join a vibrant and excellent choral community! —————————————- WELCOME: We believe that creating music is much more than sounding the right note at the right time. Exultate goes beyond the notes on the page to bring you, the listener, the personal response that makes sound into rich, meaningful music – the language of emotion. Each concert program is designed to provide a variety of sounds, styles and textures performed in spaces specifically chosen for their acoustic qualities. Whether an a cappella Renaissance motet or a complex 21st century choral and instrumental work, our mission is the same:  To perform and foster the enjoyment of classical choral and instrumental music, moving the souls of this and future generations. We look forward to adding you to our growing number of followers by inviting you to learn more about us, attend a concert, browse our catalog of recordings and support our mission through a financial gift.  Join our email list to receive periodic news and updates about our performances, events and new recordings or follow us on Facebook and Twitter. <span style="color: #a32638;"><span style="caret-color: #a32638;"><strong>– <em>Come sing the B Minor Mass with us this season!
