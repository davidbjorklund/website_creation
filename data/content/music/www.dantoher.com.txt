King. As the sessions developed NY vocalist Saundra Williams came on board to add her smooth vocals. Further sessions are planned both in LA and New York.   Back in Dublin, Dan launched the Frontier Studio with a live session which saw major Irish players Eoghan O'Neill, Robbie Casserley and Anto Drennan lay down some great tracks that are destined to feature in the International project Frontier will be launching in the US. Contributions from Uileann piper Flaithri Neff interweave with Brazilian musicians in a mesmirising fashion ... so much going on, more of which later.   Following a break due to family bereavement, Dan has completed the Frontier Studio, which will accommodate visiting celebs for project collaborations. Dan will be Manhattan based for recording/production while assembling a huge International project which will tour the main American cities.   Back in the studio , Dan has recently recorded half a dozen kickin' tracks with Robbie Casserley & Ace Bass Eoghan O'Neill in Westland.   He will be presenting some of the projects at the Cannes Music Festival this year. Details of time, place etc. will be posted here in a few days.   The London Metropolitan Orchestra crossover project is set to resume shortly as will the sessions with R'n'B singers, classical singers & rock guitarists.   Plans are being prepared to hook up with the Riverdance guys in NY, bringing in our Puerto Rican, Cuban and Dominican friends which will be the basis for some very exciting music that will see the light of day later in the year. Dan will also be hooking up with a number of American artists to get involved in these sessions and work together on another project in the near future.   Ever the traveller, Frontier hope to ease the burden of Dan's Frontier work which will enable him to source collaborations in faraway continents.   We will have a schedule of 2005 releases shortly   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Dan has expanded the range of his work to Main Producer/Writer for Frontier International - follow the link to the Frontier site to see some of these projects.   Dan has been recording in Abbey Road Studios, London with The London Metropolian Orchestra, completing the first stages of an exciting album that brings his material into new areas, including mixing the combined strengths of the LMO with the intricacies of Irish rhythms and the power of some significant Diva/Gospel talent.

Sights are now set on bringing the show to New York by the end of the year.   Dan was recently asked where he sees this all going. His reply, after a few moments thought, was that he'd "like to see the projects span the globe, bringing cultures together. I'm tired of seeing divisions." Certainly, his recent musical endeavours have been crossing a lot of boundaries.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   The eagerly anticipated Frontier Roadshow has taken longer than expected to go live mainly due to the production, writing and collaborative demands of simultaneously working on 30-40 Songs involving 5-6 Projects.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   Producing a recent series of singles put out by Frontier Records with Irish and International Artists, these latest projects of Dan's have been picking up airplay on the BBC and many Irish regional & local stations.   - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -   All singles are currently available in HMV Ireland - details on the Frontier site.
