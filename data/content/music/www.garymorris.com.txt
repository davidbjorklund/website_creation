The Abilene Fly Fishers club is associated with the Gary Morris Concert and Fundraising for Wounded Veterans. Mountain Spirit Ranch is also associated as a place where veterans suffering from PTSD can experience the therapeutic properties of the serene sport of fly fishing to treat PTSD and other combat related conditions. This program provides basic fly fishing, fly casting, fly tying, and rod building classes, along with clinics participants ranging from beginners to those with prior fly fishing and tying experience who are adapting their skills to their new abilities. Morris is very active with its various programs throughout the year and enjoys spending time with the men and women who participate in this healing sport.
