The first review is in: CD Review: http://www.midwestrecord.com/MWR1210.html CHRIS WASHBURNE/Rags & Roots: The bone man blows your mind as he blows your ears open by surrounding himself with a killer array of modern jazzbos who all pull in the same direction when he reaches back to pull a piano out of a speakeasy whore house and relocates it to a whore house on Mars. Making classic rags modern and interspersing them with materiality of Washburn’s making, this set colors ou tside the lines and invites you to take a wild ride along with it as the familiar gets turned on it’s head in a most delightful fashion. A stomping good time, leave your inhibitions a the door and check in for a good time. Well done throughout. 201701 CHRIS SPECTOR, Editor and Publisher Honored to received such a great review from Gary Walker at WBGO – a true hero and champion of jazz! http://www.wbgo.org/radar/chris-washburne-syotos-low-ridin Appearances There are no upcoming dates to display at this time.
