Several members are also teachers as well as successful composers and arrangers with a large number of commissions, concerts and broadcasts in Britain and other countries.

Recent activities include recordings with the BBC Singers for Radio 3, a live thirty minute appearance on Radio 3's 'In Tune' and a 5 day tour of Berlin and the surrounding area, culminating in a concert in the Kammersaale of the Berlin Philharmonie.  Current CD's available include 'Dancing in the dark' on the Deux-Elles record label as well as 'Chaconne Brass' and 'We are not alone'. 2014 saw a new collaboration, an exploration of Middle Eastern, Jewish & Arabic music alongside singer Belinda Sykes & accordionist Karen Street.
