ALBUM OF THE YEAR 2014 Chaos Realm THE LIE OF THE LAND IS PROBABLY THE BAND'S BEST ALBUM Nightfall in Metal Earth group column content Dave Morrissey image content Since forming Celtic Legacy with Dave Boylan in 1997, Dave has been largely responsible for the band's musical direction. The majority of the music on the first 2 albums was composed by Dave and he was also the designer of all the band's graphics, imagery and logo.   When the band broke up as a gigging entity in 2009, he took a couple of years out to concentrate on pressing domestic issues before getting the bug to begin work on a solo project, deciding to perform all the music for the album himself. Working initially with American singer Martin DeBourge (go check this guy out) , the solo album morphed into a dual project, until constantly busy schedules on both sides of the Atlantic stalled the work in progress.   The arrival of CiarÃ¡n Ennis in January 2013 moved the material into familiar territory. Before long the songs began taking on a more 'Legacy' kind of direction. column content CiarÃ¡n Ennis image content CiarÃ¡n joined Legacy early in 2007 while the band was gearing up to record the Guardian of Eternity album. Blessed with an astonishing vocal range, Ciaran distinguished himself as the band's longest serving vocalist right up until the end in April 2009.   While working on his own Mirrors of Obsidian project, CiarÃ¡n got a call in January 2013 to listen to some new material Dave Morrissey was working on and he jumped back into the fold. Once CiarÃ¡n returned, the project turned into a de-facto Celtic Legacy album.   With the break up of the established Morrissey/Boylan songwriting partnership, CiarÃ¡n had a perfect opportunity this time to set his own lyrical themes as well as his own vocal style to the new material, giving the tone a more contemporary, lyrical content. group column image content Celtic Legacy/Resurrection Re-Issue (2008) Eternal Legacy Records (ELCLCD004) group image custom html content Celtic Legacy (1998) SOLD OUT column image content The Lie of the Land Eternal Legacy Records (ELCLCD005) group column content Limited Edition CD custom html content Digital Format Available from iTunes, Amazon and all on-line stores. column image content Guardian of Eternity (2008) Eternal Legacy Records (ELCLCD003) custom html image content Resurrection (2003) SOLD OUT group content Copyright @ 1998 - 2014 Celtic Legacy/Dave Morrissey group content THE LIE OF THE LAND content BAND content ALBUMS content HOME image image image image Other scripts RequireJS script
