The Cocktail Revisionists - Official Web Site "INTOXICATING MODERN ROCK WITH A DASH OF '60s POP STYLING" The Cocktail Revs on stage at The Skylark Cafe ( photo by Ann Nightingale ) NEXT SHOW: SATURDAY, DECEMBER 1, 2012 at BARBOZA (Neumos) The Cocktail Revisionists are playing the middle slot at the CD Release show for Seattle's Mayors of Liberty . We are honored to be part of the lineup that night. Should be an outstanding show at one of Seattle's best music clubs. Praise for This is My Happy Face : "Intoxicating modern rock with a dash of '60s pop styling." -- Ben Hunter, Askew Reviews "The Cocktail Revisionists play bouncy and generally appealing pop with added jazzy and rock-flavored bits. The singer Leslie Kooy has a clear but not overly sweet voice and that appeals to me. The suggestive "This little hell" is a highlight. "Clear blue skies" is a hummable folksy delight. "Lie to me" is a sad-eyed song that still makes you smile by its sheer beauty. Kooy's singing is just brilliant. The band manage to vary the moods of their songs and make their influences their own. A wonderful and accessible record." -- Ectophile's Guide to Good Music [Click here for other reviews] WE LOVE YOU!
