Don't play alone.  Its more fun in a group! Come play with us! ECRS 2018-19 info end banner inner end banner mid end banner-right The EASTERN CONNECTICUT RECORDER SOCIETY welcomes you to our eighteenth season of recorder playing.  Here is a great opportunity to improve your skills and make beautiful music with others in a warm, supportive atmosphere. Meetings are held monthly, usually the second Saturday of the month, September through June.  Every month we have a visiting “coach,” a professional musician specializing in recorder music, who conducts us in music that is always interesting, stimulating, and accessible to a variety of playing levels. THE EARLY GROUP meets from 9:15 am - 9:50 am, providing a preview of the morning’s music, with a focus on technique and sight reading.  It is aimed at the less experienced, but all are invited to participate. We also have A MENTORING PROGRAM for those who feel they might wish to sit beside and share a part with a more experienced player.   We will meet again this year at the facilities of the CONNECTICUT FOREST AND PARK ASSOCIATION in Middlefield, Connecticut.  Please  CLICK HERE  for driving directions. Our Saturday morning playing sessions meet from 10:00 to 12:30.  Please plan to arrive at 9:30 for refreshments and "set-up".  Remember to bring your music stand and a pencil.  Music is provided by the guest coach.  We welcome again BRUCE LARKIN as our MUSIC DIRECTOR.  Bruce teaches private students in solo and ensemble lessons and is the founder of The Richmond Consort. ECRS was featured in a segment of Morning Edition on Connecticut Public Radio with Diane Orson.  To see and hear this, click here.   Web Hosting by HostMonster
