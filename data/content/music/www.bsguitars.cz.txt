BSG Guitars - Musical Instruments   I played 2 BSG guitars in Poland recently and must compliment them on their great work, both guitars were extremely well made, beautifully finished, and sounded big, rich and sweet, with a lot of volume for a small bodied guitar... I enjoyed playing both guitars, and wish BSG a lot of success in the business Tommy Emmanuel CGP. obsah "We strive for perfection when crafting our guitars.
