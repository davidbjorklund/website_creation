Our newest album "Gone to Seed" is out now. Support local music and give it a spin. Dapper Jones has played around Seattle for over 15 years. They have been spotted at places like The Crocodile, The High Dive, Slims Last Chance, The Comet, The Blue Moon, The Mix, A Terrible Beauty, and The Colour Box to name a few. We play rock like every other band, but we do think we do it with a bit more swagger and stagger. Give a listen to our stuff, have a beer and be cool. iTunes booking: rawk@dapperjones.com The JavaScript
