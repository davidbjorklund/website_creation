About the instruments we sell The anglo concertina is diatonic, playing a different note on the push and on the pull. It is often used for chanteys and American fiddle music. The C/G 30-button anglo concertina is a popular choice for Irish traditional music. The English concertina is fully chromatic and its note layout is based on the musical staff. It plays the same note on the push and on the pull. Originally designed for classical music, the English system is well-suited to folk music and chordal accompaniment. There are several duet systems of concertina. They all play the same note on the push and on the pull, and they are all designed to allow accompaniment to be played in one hand and melody lines in the other. They are suitable for all sorts of folk and popular music. Diatonic button accordions play a different note on the push and on the pull. On the right-hand side, each row of buttons is in a different key. The left-hand side features bass and chord buttons. Different styles of button accordion are popular for many sorts of folk music, including Irish, English, French, and many Latin styles. Piano accordions feature a piano-like keyboard on the right hand, with chords and basses on the left hand. These accordions are fully chromatic and suitable for jazz, classical, folk, and popular music. Chromatic button accordions are fully chromatic and play the same note on the push and on the pull. The right-hand fingerboard consists of 3 to 5 rows of buttons arranged chromatically, and the left-hand side features bass and chords. These accordions are a popular choice for jazz, classical, and many styles of European music. Brands we carry We stock new accordions from Castagnari, Saltarelle, Serenellini, Brandoni, Weltmeister, and Hohner . We cannot predict what used instruments will become available, but we usually have instruments available from those same makers as well as the occasional Paolo Soprani, Sonola, Titano, Petosa, Cairdín, Gaillard, and so on. We carry new and used concertinas from our own brand, R. Morse & Co., as well as Stagi , Concertina Connection , and various other modern makers.
