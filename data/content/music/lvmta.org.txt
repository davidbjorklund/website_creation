We are always in need of some helping hands! Getting involved and assuming leadership positions in LVMTA not only keeps the organization running for the benefit of our local students and teachers, but it also increases YOUR visibility as a teacher and leadership figure. It's a great way to give back, build a network, make friends, and gain student referrals! ​ Available Leadership Roles (updated November 2018): Jazz Festival Committee/Co-Chair Silver State Committee/Co-Chair Roger Bushell Competition Committee/Co-Chair NFMC Junior Festival Committee Musicianship Committee ​ Please get in touch with Marlene Meagher and let us know in which area(s) you might like to serve! We will be very happy to place you on a committee so that you can ease into things, get a feel for your event, and perhaps assume a leadership position in the near future!
