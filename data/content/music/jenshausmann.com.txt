About –  Projects –  CD Precious Moments With an extensive background in all kinds of styles and genres and a lifelong passion for guitar music, Jens Hausmann has come a long way from his debut with original singer/songwriter material to instrumental crossover fingerstyle pieces, as it seems. But eventually, after honing his craft for over 30 years, with his sophomore album „Precious Moments“ the virtuoso guitarist has come full circle, since he started out with jazz duets and jazz bands and studying classical music in the first place. The new album features solo fingerstyle guitar music without any overdubs, recorded in a vaulted cellar with just two microphones. A lot of improvisation is included, played passionately by a classically trained artist with a blend of styles somewhere between jazz, latin, folk, blues, classical and world music. For about 30 years Jens Hausmann has been a working musician live, in the studio and giving guitar-lessons. His passion for the guitar has taken him down many diverse stylistic paths, from the beginnings with classical music and roots in folk and jazz, through blues, rock, pop, latin, flamenco and back to classical music. Over the years Jens collected lots of experience and had his share in all kinds of music, working solo, or as a sideman in bands, big bands and even orchestras. That gave him the chance to develop his unique guitar style and singer/songwriter music. His debut singer/songwriter album, “Back On The Track”, was released in 1999 on which his acoustic guitar playing is prominently featured, nowadays the main focus is on fingerstyle nylon string guitar. Currently Hausmann is working solo, in duos and as a sideman on acoustic and electric guitars, bass, mandolin, ukulele and vocals. Besides playing and teaching he writes reviews, workshops and interviews for the German Magazine ‘Akustik Gitarre’. Journalist Jens Hausmann has been author and photographer for the German magazine Akustik Gitarre since 2002. He also wrote for other German magazines like Anda!, Blues-News and Gitarre & Bass. For Akustik Gitarre he covers just about everything between workshops including recordings, interviews, CD and gear reviews, and other stories like factory-tours which lead him to the U.S., Canada, Japan and Spain. Hausmann is specialized on acoustic guitars and related topics. Occasionally he also writes promo texts for record labels.

So don’t hesitate to get in contact. I’d like to share my perspective here: How do I strengthen my playing, my ideas, my techniques and develop my skills so I can create precious moments in music over and over again? Very simple: we all need to flex our creative muscles often through practice, inspiration and expert education. Otherwise, our playing will become stagnant and repetitive. At some point it will be unfulfilling, not as exciting as it used to be, not getting any further anymore. I consume musical education like candy. I LOVE to learn new techniques, find new ideas, get inspired and it’s great to move on and never reaching a plateau, where you don’t know where to go next. Instead, I’m constantly inspired, love trying something new, with the goal to create more fascinating music, that pleases me and the listener. For me it’s the best feeling, and I make sure to never lose it. How about you? Come and join me, there’s a lot to share!

Artist of the Week at Fingerstyle-guitar.com First Album Back On The Track reviews: Rambles.net Folkworld.de More: „Jens has the unique talent of serving up his intricate technique in a simple fashion, Lindsey Buckingham lovers should hear this guy!“ Chapman James, Besonic.com „Thanks so much for your CD. I was very impressed by your work – songwriting, guitar and vocals! Wow – excellent. I wish I could play guitar like that!“ New York, Diane Ponzio, Singer/Songwriter „I enjoyed listening to your CD, you’ve done a wonderful job. Yes, I do hear some influences of my work in your music!“ Brussels, Philip Catherine, Jazz Guitarist Irene Jackson about the song Shaggy Old Dog at godsofmusic It’s only in the last few years that I’ve come to really appreciate jazz and especially the blues. And if you think writing a blues song is a walk through the park, well, just try it yourself sometime. It’s hard not to sound lyrically cliché and trite, and it’s really difficult to come up with chords progression that don’t sound like every other blues chord progression you’ve ever heard. Go on, try it. I dare ya. Jens Hausmann is a German-born blues/jazz guitarist and singer/songwriter who has the blues all figured out, and then some. Shaggy Old Dog is a great number featuring only silky smooth electric guitar riffs and vocals oozing with personality, and who needs anything else? It’s fun, it’s classy and full of that feeling of ants in your pants when you’re listening to someone who can REALLY play. In fact, while you’re checking out Shaggy Old Dog, you might sniff through a few of Jens‘ other songs, some of a more serious lyrical nature, some on acoustic guitar, others with a more latin flavour in the mix. They’re minimally arranged, only the bare essentials, they’re well-recorded and very nice to sit back and soak up. If you’re a fan of blues and jazz, Jens Hausmann is certainly someone you should have a listen to 🙂 Owwwwoooooohhh… #content #primary .searchform Neue Beiträge Audio Streaming Gitarrenunterricht Detmold Jens Hausmann Guitarsonic Workshops .inner-wrap #main Impressum Impressum Datenschutz Datenschutz Meta Anmelden Beitrags-Feed ( RSS ) Kommentare als RSS WordPress.org Copyright © 2019 Jens Hausmann Theme by: ThemeGrill Powered by: WordPress #page
