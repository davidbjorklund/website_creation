Fun Times Singers - a community chorus singing fun music in Santa Clara County <body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"> <h1>The Fun Times Singers</h1> We are a community chorus that provides music education, performance opportunities, group singing, and socialization with others who enjoy singing in Santa Clara County. <p> While a professional performance that delights our audience is our goal, we always keep in mind that FUN is our primary objective. <h2>What We Sing</h2> We sing songs that delight the ear and the soul. We sing a variety of music with the exception, for the most part, of classical. Examples are contemporary and standard pop such as, Chattanooga Choo-Choo, Over The Rainbow; music from the movies and Broadway (from early to the present) including works by composers such as Rodgers, Webber, Lerner, Porter, Gershwin, Berlin, Bernstein, etc. <p> We also sing patriotic songs, spirituals, folk, etc. Our holiday concert is a mix of Hanukkah, Christmas, and secular songs of the season.

In 2000, Shirley Garner took over the director's stand and the chorus flourished under her enthusiastic leadership. When Shirley retired in 2002, we were delighted to attract our current Director, Laura Green, whose musical talent and experience infuses the concert program with rhythm and magic. <p> Our members come many different cities, including Campbell, San Jose, Sunnyvale, Santa Clara, Saratoga, Los Gatos, Mountain View, Santa Clara, Milpitas, Cupertino, Los Alto, and Palo Alto. <p> Here is some <a href="locator.php">Background Information</a><br> <p> This website was developed by Rich Guyon.
