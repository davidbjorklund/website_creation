Bjärv's fresh, contemporary interpretations of traditional Swedish folk songs breathe new life into the music of the 18th century. Infused with youthful charm, their innovative, stunning 3-part harmonies and show-stopping improvisational musicianship make their live performances a memorably rocking good time for all audiences. The trio has been touring the United States and Scandinavia since the release of their self-titled CD in 2002. Appearances in the U.S. include: World Fest, Grass Valley, CA, Festival of Cultures, Sioux Falls, SD, Hjemkomstfestival, Fargo, ND, Svenskarnas Dag, Minneapolis, MN, Sawdust Festival, Laguna Beach, CA, Summer Series, Salt Lake City, UT, and Mid-summer festival, Estes Park, CO, as well as radio performances on "Folkscene" KPFK, 90,7 FM and KPIG, 94,9 FM.
