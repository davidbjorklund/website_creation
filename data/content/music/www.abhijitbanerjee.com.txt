We are touring in Denmark with Arhus Jazz orchestra and Randers chamber orchestra, Me and Kala. Lars Moller is the conductor. It is a mind blowing experience. Because of his Indian music Background, Lars knows how to deal with Indian Music. He is making the orchestra play a composition in Vilambit Ektaal and Alap etc. It is mind blowing. I am free to play my postion yet it is composed. Really wonderful compositional idea. Lots to learn. Also the compositions has really point and counterpoint and structue of developments which are mind blowing. I am really learning a lot.  A mind blowing experience. / content IMPORTANT LINKS Profile Performances <a href="achievements.php?page=association"> <p class="color-2 p5">Accompaniment</p> </a> <a href="achievements.php?page=association"> <p class="color-2 p5">Association</p> </a> Awards <a href="media.php?page=print"> <p class="color-2 p5">Broadcast Media</p> </a> <a href="releases.php?page=audio"> <p class="color-2 p5">Music Labels</p> </a> Resleases Calendar Creations <a href="releases.php?page=video"> <p class="color-2 p5">Chapters</p> </a> USEFUL LINKS The Music Room <a href="video.php"> <p class="color-2 p5">Video Gallery</p> </a> Seminars Media <a href="#"> <p class="color-2 p5">World Music</p> </a> Downloads Moments...
