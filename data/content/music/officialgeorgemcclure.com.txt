It embraces them. "Cow jazz, Western country, Dixieland and Texas blues, TexMex, bluegrass and gospel all fit into his extraordinary breadth." George is a multi-dimensional writer (his "Alien Love" hit in Japan, the first 5-string banjo improv book, a musical, hundreds of songs & instrumentals, and a stunning autobiography in narrative style), but perhaps the most impressive aspect of his music is its variety and depth. George sums it all up as "American music on hyperdrive - Southwest style."

[Woody Guthrie, from Pastures of Plenty ] "from dirt roads and street corners... to CMT Nashville" Autobiography " Iridescent Poppies and Lollipop Mommies " Aculturated in the rich desert heritage of Arizona and northern Mexico (Sonora and Chihuahua), the native sounds of Mariachi, norteno, and Marty Robbins echo in George McClure's music, as well as his childhood classical and world music. George started playing professionally in Arizona and New Mexico bars and clubs, playing banjo and bass. "We couldn't get off the stage without playing a few Bob Wills and Texas swing numbers" , George says. "And we had a guy in our band who grooved on all the swing. The complex chords and structures thrilled me." A little later in Carolina an old black bluesman (who had toured with Lightnin' Hopkins) took an interest in George and showed him some of what he knew on guitar. This amalgam became the core of George's music. George spent 24 years in Nashville, touring with McClure's America and the Matadors and where he built McClure & Trowbridge Publishing, a successful music company. McClure is also a poet and author ! Visit George on george mcclure.net (official sanctioned dossier.) George went pro here (Tucson AZ), where he wrote "Mass Grass", as well as polyphonic classical works, and he transcribed Vivaldi's Violin Concerto in Am for acoustic ensemble. He lived here 1978-1979. ------------------------------ TABLE : Template 2 -------------------------- ------------------------------ QUOTES -------------------------- ------------------------------ FOOTER -------------------------- All Rights Reserved © 2000 - present McClure & Trowbridge Publishing PID: M1/M1 – Last Updated 11 Cauac, 9th Wave of Creation - or 17 jul 2019 Official George McClure | JIP Records | george mcclure.net | Planet Trowbridge
