Rated 5 out of 5 Customer Review Item by Maggie Gee on 16/06/2019 08:31:00 Order completed in good time, goods delivered promptly and well packed, now forwarded. Crazy that I have to buy guitar strings to send to my Grandson in Spain, but there you have it. He also has some new finger picks and a string winder as a bit of a bonus now too ! For such things to be not available in rural Spain, the so-called 'home of the Guitar' is bizarre ! Order completed in good time, goods delivered promptly and well packed, now forwarded.
