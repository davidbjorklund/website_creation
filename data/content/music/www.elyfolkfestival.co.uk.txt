What better location for a weekend of the best in folk music and dance? Each Ely Folk Festival is better than the last, with an impressive guest list and programme of workshops, concerts, morris displays, ceilidhs and children’s entertainment. The musicians appearing at the Ely Folk Festival reflect the rich diversity of the modern folk and roots music scene, with a mixture of established favourites and newer talent. Our festival patron is internationally acclaimed singer-songwriter and local resident, Boo Hewerdine. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column We are proud to remain a small, friendly festival. That means that you can meet the artists ‘unplugged’, take part in workshops, dances, sessions or perform in the Club Tent, and you can get really close to the main stages. The Folk Festival is based on a single site which includes marquees, camping facilities, food stalls, trade stands, real-ale bar, & children’s entertainment. Ely city centre is accessible by shuttle bus or 20 minutes’ walk. Morris sides perform on the festival site and in town on Saturday and Sunday. There is space for tents and caravans on site, and free parking is located on the festival site.
