Learn More Our Mission The mission of the West Valley Youth Orchestra program is to offer young talented musicians an opportunity to participate with their peers in an orchestral setting. This experience provides intensive training so participants will develop greater music understanding, ability and appreciation. The organization also encourages a lifelong musical journey by providing an adult program. There are three performing groups in the program during the school year. Cadet Strings is a training ensemble for beginning string players. The West Valley Youth Orchestra is a full orchestra with strings, woodwinds. brass and percussion players.  Bravo Strings is an ensemble for adults. We also offer a Chamber Music Camp in June for a week of coaching with Quartet Sabaku. Every year our ensembles perform in a variety of concerts around the Phoenix metropolitan area. We have string festivals and workshops, and participate in side-by-side concerts with the West Valley Symphony. Since there are few string music programs in the local school systems, we provide a needed service to our community. Members of our youth orchestras, adult string ensemble and summer chamber music camp come from Avondale, Litchfield Park, Goodyear, Peoria, Glendale, Buckeye, Surprise, Tolleson and other areas of West Phoenix.
