If Dave was owed respect before, he deserves even more after this album.”   SPILL MAGAZINE “This is an album in every sense of the word…A terrific album"   CONSEQUENCE OF SOUND “Never have they sounded as locked-in as they do on new track Path Is Long. Good, honest, traditional songs that play to each songwriter’s strengths.”   SONG WRITING MAGAZINE “A revealing and rewarding listen – a sentimental and carefully crafted album” GENERAL ENQUIRIES Email:  ddmusic.media@gmail.com HOME More No Footer body end html embeds start body end html embeds end
