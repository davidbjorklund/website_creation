BTR is an independent research and development lab advancing technology in fields including music (violin bows, electric guitars and basses), software, automotive parts, and modular structures. The 496ROC Guitar and the Born To Rock F4 Guitar and Bass are the professional's choice in electric instruments for touring or studio recording. An aluminum framework produces attack and overtones impossible to achieve on wooden guitars. Think of the difference between the dynamics of a piano (with a metal frame) and a harpsichord, and you can imagine the improvement this creates. Get the resonance of a fine acoustic, with the crunch and sustain of an electric. Hold it, play it, you'll never look back! Copyright Â© 1995, 2019 Born To Rock Design Incorporated .
