Still not convinced? Here is another one: .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb Reason three I come from a Family of Drummers.  My Dad was a Master Drum Instructor who taught my Uncle, Brother, Me, and over 2500 students in a career that lasted close to 40 years.  Much of that time I not only studied how to play, but was taught how to teach.  I look forward to each lesson when I get to pay this gift forward! .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section My  Work Here are some examples of Videos I have recorded, edited, and posted on my YouTube Channel.  Hover over each graphic for a description of the video and click to check it out and Subscribe to my YouTube Channel If you like what I do and want to know more: Contact Us .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Video Introduction In this introduction video, Lou Stavris demonstrates techniques learned through a lifetime of study & provides information regarding the school. + learn more .et_pb_code_inner .et_pb_code .et_pb_column Teaching Innovations An Automated Slide Show covering the Innovative teaching techniques used at The DrumChops Drum School + learn more .et_pb_code_inner .et_pb_code .et_pb_column Solo - Double Bass Fills Here is a short Drum Solo with Double Bass fills recorded and edited at the DrumChops Drum School Studio. + learn more .et_pb_code_inner .et_pb_code .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Lou Stavris - Pop Classic Cover Lou Stavris Owner/Instructor @ The DrumChops Drum School - Covers The Pop Classic "Jenny, 867-5309" + learn more .et_pb_code_inner .et_pb_code .et_pb_column Rudimental Demonstration Lou Stavris puts his spin on "The Connecticut Halftime".

It got me out of playing one style of music and becoming more open to jazz, Latin, and other styles which have made me become a better player in Jazz band at school. I would definitely check out taking lessons at DrumChops! You may start out simple but will move on to more advanced stuff at your own pace..” Isaiah V. | Teen .et_pb_testimonial_description_inner .et_pb_testimonial_description .et_pb_testimonial “ This email is to let you know that I am thrilled that my student Diego P. Is taking lessons from you!  After last week’s first lesson, he came to band happy to show me some of the things you worked on with him and seriously, he was already keeping better time!  I’m hopeful that my other percussionists will note his improvement and his enthusiasm for your studio and investigate lessons as well! . Thanks for being there!” James H. | Band Director @ Dysart WP .et_pb_testimonial_description_inner .et_pb_testimonial_description .et_pb_testimonial .et_pb_column “ Our middle school son has been attending private 1 hour drum lessons with Lou for a year.  Because of Lou, he was the youngest drummer to make the Jazz band!  Lou is a solid teacher.  Always on time, and flexible to make- up missed lessons instead of going without, which my son loves.  Lou’s studio is setup with two drum sets, giving the unique opportunity for student & teacher to work on new skills together on full acoustic sets.   We were referred to Lou by the Band Director at West Point because one of his students improved so much in just six months, that he asked who his instructor was.  Lou’s prices and policies are fair and, most importantly, our son doesn’t want to go elsewhere after a year! ‘Nuff said! ” Trish I. | Parent - Pre-Teen .et_pb_testimonial_description_inner .et_pb_testimonial_description .et_pb_testimonial “Lou was my patient teacher for some time.  I can’t imagine anyone else in the West Valley who has the talent, resume, and genes Lou does.  He comes from a family of Masters… you could NOT go wrong!” David S. | Adult .et_pb_testimonial_description_inner .et_pb_testimonial_description .et_pb_testimonial .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section Follow DrumChops on Social Media .et_pb_text Connect with DrumChops on FaceBook Facebook end .et_pb_widget .et_pb_widget_area Follow Follow Follow Follow Follow Follow .et_pb_counters google-site-verification: googleda60c6b561f984d5.html .et_pb_text .et_pb_column  The DrumChops Drum School 11785 N. 140th Lane Surprise, Az 85379 .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column  Info@DrumChops.com .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb  623-546-9738 .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section .entry-content .et_pb_post #main-content DrumChops Drum School Home Page Jimmie Stavris Sr. – Dedication Forte Music Publications Contact Us About Us #et-footer-nav Facebook Twitter Designed by Lou Stavris .container #main-footer #et-main-area #page-container
