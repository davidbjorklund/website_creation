From that review: “Current Day takes an incredible left turn at track number three, “Julie (You’re Dreaming),” by incorporating synths, the effect similar to what Arcade Fire does so well (adding new wave cool to songs rooted in folk/rock music). The following cut, “On the Level,” continues this trend—burbling synthesizer lays down a funky, danceable groove … Album closer “Always Talking” aims for dizzy heights and succeeds quite beautifully.“ Source bandcamp.us1.list-manage.com Aug 24th, 2018 Share this Share this Music Defined has a review of our release show, with photos and videos to boot.
