"We think this is going to be our best tour to date. The goal is to really connect with the fans of the incredible band that is PINK FLOYD" explains AK, Founder, Lead Guitars & Vocals and Executive Producer for Comfortably Numb. "From the songs selections and their re-worked 70's concepts, to our light and sound production, fans will be able to experience a psychedelic 70's Pink Floyd concert". "Remember musically, the mood and feel of our show is very different than what Pink Floyd toured with during the 'Delicate Sound Of Thunder' and 'Pulse' Tours as the early 70's shows included all four members of Pink Floyd who had an approach to the music that was exciting and new - not simply replicating it but giving it new life each and every show. Even though technology in the 70's was very different at that time we will still have a state-of-the-art show. The band and production team have been working feverishly hard to get this right, we are looking forward to performing these shows!" says AK. main ends sidebar starts   Click the image below to enter the online family memorial website dedicated in loving memory of Solveig Keshavjee PERFORMING THE MUSIC OF PINK FLOYD SINCE 1993 â CANADA'S ORIGINAL LIVE PINK FLOYD EXPERIENCE!
