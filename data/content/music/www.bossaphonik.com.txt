FORTHCOMING... Friday 12 th July, 9pm-2am, band at 10pm @ The Isis Farmhouse riverside pub, near Iffley Lock. This Bossaphonik night runs on the 2nd Friday of July 12th and features singer/violinist/composer Azhaar Saffar and her band Global Wave, with a change of venue - The Isis Farmhouse Pub. Azhaar established her reputation fronting and co-writing with highly regarded Brazilian jazz act Sirius B who played twice at Bossaphonik’s early period in 2006. The band reached no. 1 on the Jazz FM playlist charts and Japanese Brazilian music chart and were also regulars at Camden's Jazz Cafe. After an absence spent enjoying a nomadic lifestyle travelling and touring South America, Azhaar returns to the UK with her new project Global Wave. The sound is in some ways a continuation of the fusion grooves of Sirus B but casts a wider net focusing on groovy soul-jazz with Latin and Brazilian foundations, even taking in some Arabic and African influences into the funky jazz fusion. Azhaar composed much of the music during inspiring times spent exploring jungles and surfing. Global Wave’s debut LP “Original Love” was released in 2018 and features jazz-dance percussionist/DJ giant Snowboy on production and renowned jazz flautist Gareth Lockrane. The album has received a big thumbs-up from the jazz-dance community and has received much worldwide radio play. “One of the most distinctive acts on the jazz world scene” Andy Roberts BBC Radio Wales “Azhaar expresses herself with grounded experience, full of joy and passion” Fernando Rose Check out the Global Wave LP here: www.azhaarsaffar.com/music1-1 And a video from Glastonbury: www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRD9OePhFMg Following the band, the venue will turn into Bossaphonik club session til 2am!
