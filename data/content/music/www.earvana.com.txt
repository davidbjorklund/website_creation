The patented technology is a uniquely designed nut created to improve the sound of your guitar. You have probably noticed that it is nearly impossible to tune your guitar so that the chords in the first 5 frets ring true for any open chords. Earvana has solved this problem by developing a nut that compensates for the errors that are inherent in 99% of all stringed instruments. Tune In to the Laws of Physics. Note: All claims are substantiated using state of the art strobe tuners so that the most skeptical and discriminating ear can hear and see for themselves.
