Border Strathspey & Reel Society's website Home News Music Photos Links Contact Membership Information Concerts Repertoire Welcome to the BSRS website! The Border Strathspey & Reel Society was formed in 1973 to play traditional Strathspeys & Reels and preserve them for future generations. We meet monthly to play tunes and have fun with them! We believe there's no point in the playing if there's no enjoyment! We are comprised of fiddlers, pianists, accordionists, cellists, base players, flautists, pipers and drummers and we are happy to bring in anyone with an instrument and an interest. In our concerts, the society normally plays for charity at venues all across southern Scotland and northern England. We always welcome & encourage new members, so if you wish to find out more about us, feel free to explore our website or pop along to one of our regular rehearsals or try-out sessions! The Border Strathspey and Reel Society meets to rehearse on the first Monday of every month in Canonbie at the United Reformed Church. Car parking is available and there is a refreshment break during the rehearsal. Rehearsals usually last from 7:00pm until around 9:00pm. Next rehearsal: Monday 2nd September 2019, 6.45pm for the rehearsal at 7.00pm Please note new time.
