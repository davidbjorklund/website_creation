Mathias Ziegler performed the world premiere of 'Aurora/Sunrise Concerto' by Sophie Dufeutrelle. The Concerto is for the Contrabass/quartertone flute and orchestra. Philippe Bernold directed the Geneva Chamber Orchestra. David Straubinger, who created and made the special pads for the Eva Kingma flutes, also attended the Premiere. Sophie Dufeutrelle, who plays a Straubinger Flute, performed and directed her flute Sextet, 'PentaGônes' at the Festival. Excerpts from the Festival Grand Finale Concert are now posted on YouTube: youtu.be/Z2uQVlQIzhI . Numerous samples of Sophie Dufeutrelle's work may be heard on YouTube: youtu.be/VzhbGcXS378 . Jasmine Choi: Claude Bolling Suite for Flute and Jazz Trio on YouTube. October202014 <i>"Many of us remember Rampal's iconic recording of the Bolling Suite. Granted Rampal's recording is a challenging act to follow, but Choi quite successfully brings a fresh and definitive look to the score. The playing is explosive and nuanced. This CD should be on the 'must have' list for serious flutists." - Flute Talk Magazine</i></font> <h4>Jasmine Choi: Saint-Saens <a href="http://youtu.be/caorW4qBzJc" target="_blank">Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso</a></h4> "Choi's rendition of the Fantasy for flute solo in D Major by Friedrich Kuhlau, a performance notable for both its virtuosity and lyricism, did not disappoint. One of the most striking aspects of Choi's recital was her openness and honesty -- connecting with her audience on a personal level." - Review of March 16, 2014 recital in "Pipeline" the Chicago Flute Club Newsletter. FLUTES - PADS AND PRECISION by David Straubinger What are Straubinger pads? How are they different from traditional felt pads? How are they similar? Why do Straubinger pads require special training and certification for technicians? Learn the answers to these questions and much more as woodwind pioneer, David Straubinger, explores the basic challenges encountered in flute repair and presents an overview of the pads and repair techniques he has developed to address these challenges. It promises to be a fascinating discussion of how the Straubinger pad came to be and why precision is the key and an absolute requirement to successful installation. The results achieved with Straubinger pads are phenomenal and the possibilities for the player are limitless, but if the flute is not properly prepared, it will never produce optimum results. So, as a repair technician, WHY is this important to you? Regardless of the level of flutes you work on, the standard expected by flute clients has been raised by the influence of the Straubinger pad. As a result, any 21st century woodwind technician should have, at the very least, a general but accurate understanding of what these pads are all about. Moving past the basics lifts the repairman into a whole new realm of discovery, where he or she is able to interpret the player?s desire for color and tonal richness and make it happen with their flute. Come and join David for an opportunity to see what can happen and how it happens for those who want to go the extra mile. In Passing July 27, 2015 - We extend our deepest sympathy to David Straubinger whose Mother passed away peacefully this morning at 97. In the past weeks, she has been surrounded by her children and many of the family and friends who came to share their love and caring. Both of David?s parents came from a musical background. He credits his Mom for giving him her ticket to attend a concert that ultimately led to meeting the featured performer. Out of that chance opportunity evolved a long-time friendship and at the encouragement of Mr. Matheny, David won a position to study at Butler and then, a full scholarship to Julliard. this is ending Arial for wide top of page Workshops for Straubinger™ Pad Certification in Indianapolis, IN 2016     Applications are being received for the March 2016 Certification Workshops on March 9-13.
