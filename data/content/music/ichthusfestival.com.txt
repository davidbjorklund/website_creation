Ichthus Festival Creation Festivals will not be holding the 2016 Ichthus Festival. Asbury University has been a supporter and partner with the ICHTHUS festivals for many years. When Creation Festivals determined earlier this year that they would not continue the ICHTHUS festival, Asbury was privileged to be able to enter into an agreement to obtain the rights to the ICHTHUS name and legacy. "Over the next couple years we will be praying and discussing how to shepherd this important history and mission and want to thank all those who in the past have been involved in this great ICHTHUS legacy. We commit to carefully determine how the ICHTHUS mission and the mission of Asbury University may intersect in some way in the future." - Asbury University Follow Ichthus Festival on Facebook for future announcements.
