LMBB is a recreational, non-auditioned band that plays music arranged for British-style brass band. Instrumentation follows British brass band practice, with cornets, flugelhorn, Eb alto (tenor) horns, baritone horns, euphoniums, trombones, basses and percussion. However, the band has at times in the past included F horns and trumpets as well. Little Mountain Brass Band started in September 1995, at the initiative of music director Jim Littleford . The majority of the members of the new band comprised members and alumni of the Summer Pops Youth Orchestra of Vancouver. For the first season, LMBB held its rehearsals in a church hall at the foot of Vancouver's Little Mountain, a local landmark, hence the band's name. The season concluded with a performance in April, 1996, with 30 band members performing. In September, 1996, rehearsals moved to Bethlehem Lutheran Church, nearby in central Vancouver. Sufficient numbers permitted the operation of two band divisions, the "regular" one, and one for less experienced members . In October, 2000, the band moved rehearsals to Marpole United Church in southwest Vancouver. Operation of the development band was suspended in September, 2004, due to insufficient demand. Rehearsals moved to St. Mary's Anglican Church in the Kerrisdale neighborhood of central Vancouver in September, 2005 to accommodate a band growing in size. In early 2013, rehearsals moved to the Vancouver Opera Association's Martha Lou Henley Rehearsal Hall in East Vancouver. The band occasionally participates in non-competitive festivals, such as the Vancouver Kiwanis Band Festival (2003), the Northwest International Brass Band Festival (Bellevue, WA - 2004, 2005 and 2006) and the Ladner Bandfest (2005, 2007-2018). fileupdated.php - Gene Chan 2004 05 16, revised 2004 09 02 An "include" file to display the date and time of last update to page Updated 2018 Jun 10, 13:26
