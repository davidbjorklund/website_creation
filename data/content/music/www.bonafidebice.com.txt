And from the crew of Apollo 8, we close with good night, good luck, a Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you — all of you on the good Earth. “To see the earth as it truly is, small and blue and beautiful in that eternal silence where it floats, is to see ourselves as riders on the earth together, brothers on that bright liveliness in the eternal cold — brothers who know now they are truly brothers.” – Archibald MacLeish 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice New music! Posted on September 11, 2018 11:37 pm by Jennheifer Yep, we’re still here. And so is Bo. There’s been some upheaval this year. He’s parted ways with Blood, Sweat, and Tears and moved back to his beloved Helena where he’s opened a music store. Some things haven’t changed though – the man can SING. Check out Bo’s duet with Jessica Meuse on her song Without You . Idol fans may remember Jessica from Season 13. This song comes from her new album Halfhearted . Here she is telling Fred Bronson in Billboard how the collaboration came about: One of the tracks on the album is “Without You,” a duet with another American Idol alum, Bo Bice. How did that come about? I knew Bo and we’ve chatted a lot. He’s a nice guy, and he’s very easy to befriend and talk to and he always replies. He’s just a cool dude, super chill, super humble and so down to earth. I wrote “Without You” about somebody I dated. I was sitting in his apartment and I just felt discouraged. You know how when you have a big dream and it feels impossible, you have bad days sometimes. It’s tough to make it in music or any part of the entertainment industry. I asked my boyfriend at the time, “Do you believe in me?” And he went on this 45-minute rant about “I don’t know if the music industry is right for you. I don’t think you can handle it.” He told me that I should get a real job while I still can or else I’ll be too old to get one. That was when I knew this is the wrong person for me. Somebody who truly loves you no matter what your flaws are, no matter your bad days, your good days, your best, your worst, would never say that to you. When I asked, “Do you believe in me?” all I needed was a “yes” but instead he put me down. That crushed me because I loved this person and I couldn’t believe he had said that and then I wrote “Without You.” My manager said we should make it a duet and I immediately said “Bo Bice.” We didn’t really have anyone else in mind. We flew Bo out to Capitol Studios and we knocked out his vocals in a day. It was really easy. I couldn’t stop laughing. That guy is so funny. It was the best day because Bo is so much fun and we were all cracking up and having a good time. It didn’t feel like work. You can download the album or track on Jessica’s website . Man, isn’t it great to hear Bo’s voice on something new? He’s still got it. 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Merry Christmas Posted on December 24, 2017 1:55 am by Jennheifer Silent Holy Night – Bo Bice (vocals and guitar), Andrea Young (vocals and violin), arranged by D.

It’s time for cook-outs, flag-waving, and BFB’s favorite brand of fireworks – Bo Bice singing the Star Spangled Banner . We’ve heard Bo sing the national anthem many times – he loves to do it and he always does it well. No melisma, no pretentions, no making it his own, just a sure and simple reverence. Now, singing the national anthem is in no way a contest. But if it was… Nobody does it better Makes me feel sad for the rest Nobody does it half as good as you Baby, you’re the best 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Catching up Posted on February 9, 2016 9:32 pm by Jennheifer The blog looks a little different these days, ever since our theme gained self-awareness and decided to do some redecorating on its own. While the two of us try to come to an understanding, enjoy the best picture of Bo we’ve had for a while. 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Merry Christmas, peeps!

Silent Holy Night – Bo Bice (vocals and guitar), Andrea Young (vocals and violin), arranged by D. Scott Miller. 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Videos And I have loved you wild Posted on September 21, 2015 5:32 pm by Jennheifer I’ve been rummaging around in my pile of oldies but goodies lately, and I came across this great Seven Bridges Road/Midnight Rider duet with Bo and Gary Nichols, plus Tommy Lee on keyboards. The screaming, the harmonies, all that hair – it’s awesome! Hope you enjoy the flashback as much as I do. 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Friends of Bo Videos Tommy in 2016 Posted on August 8, 2015 7:35 pm by Jennheifer Peep favorite and keyboard master Thomas Lee is making music and blogs again. Despite being a full 50% of the duo Kaity and The Flood , Tommy still has time to show love to his old bandmates : Thomas here… we got to meet up with Bo Bice last night. Yes, THE Bo Bice. The guy from American Idol. The guy that changed the face of the show. He’s the one responsible for blowing the doors open for rockers to appear on those types of programs. I had the opportunity to tour with Bo for years after he finished AI, playing keyboards and guitar. We did so many shows all over the country, and I was lucky to perform live on shows such as Regis & Kelly, Craig Ferguson, and Jimmy Kimmel. Bo and I have remained good friends, so you can imagine how thrilled I was to see Bo perform again. Before the show, Bo sat down with us for a while, telling everyone some hilarious stories about the time with me on the road. It was fun reliving some of those moments… like the time we all got locked out of the bus and had to push Bo through the small driver side window. We all thought he would get stuck, but he somehow managed to wriggle through and save the day. What a show! Bo has been touring with Blood, Sweat, and Tears, and WOW his voice sounds incredible. I was stunned. I sat back in my chair and said, “Wow,” a few times. The look on Kaity’s face told me that she agreed. Bo’s right, Tommy, you should run for president. This can be your campaign song. 📂 This entry was posted in Bo Bice Friends of Bo Videos BFB headquarters Posted on July 28, 2015 8:17 pm by Jennheifer Live moderator cam: We aren’t getting anywhere with the forum issues, but at least we look cute not doing it.
