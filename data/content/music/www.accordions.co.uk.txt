Emilio Allodi Ideally, we hope you will come to the shop personally, so you may see, and more importantly, try out the different instruments available.  It is essential to be able to play, hear and feel the differences between the various models in the same place, so that they may be compared acoustically; instruments can vary quite dramatically in sound depending on a room's size, type of flooring etc....   You might like to check out our Allodi/Fantini player's rogues gallery. The biggest and best advantage of visiting in person of course, is that you will undoubtedly gain from our knowledge and years of experience.  However, that said, the website is designed to be the next best thing, allowing you to view our business from the comfort of your own home and in addition, have some vital questions answered that you may have been asking yourself before taking the plunge and purchasing your own accordion.  Refer to our section expert advice and Pre-War accordions.   Alternatively, you can check out our tutors and books   page in which you will find a list of accordion tutors in case you are looking for someone to give you lessons, or simply a tutor book to work from or go to our accessories section if you are simply looking to replace your accordion straps for instance or would like MIDI fitted to your existing instrument IMPORTANT NOTICE TWO ACCORDIONS HAVE BEEN STOLEN FROM THE SHOP.
