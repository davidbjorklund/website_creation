It’s Finland speaking. The Society of Finnish Composers proudly presents the programme of Nordic Music Days 2018 in Helsinki. Edvard Grieg was performing at the first edition of Nordic Music Days 1888, Jean Sibelius in 1919 and now it’s time for Anekdoten to follow in the footsteps of these masters. We’re very much looking forward to playing in Finland again after 12 long years. ❤️ Date: 10/11/2018 Stage Time: 10:30PM Infos: nordicmusicdays.org text end Posted by Jan Erik Liljeström in Uncategorized and tagged as posted end top-post end May 3, 2018 Gig in Rome announced Scandinavian Prog Festival, Rome, Italy, June 3.  Tickets here. text end Posted by Olivia Willson-Piper in Uncategorized and tagged as posted end top-post end February 2, 2018 Gig in Milan announced FIM Fiera – Prog On, Milan, Italy, June 2 with Prowlers, Hollowscene & La Fabbrica dell’Assoluto.  Tickets here. text end Posted by Jan Erik Liljeström in Uncategorized and tagged as posted end top-post end January 9, 2018 First gigs for 2018 announced Close To The Rain – Bergen prog festival, Norway, June 8 – 9 with Tusmørke, Alwanzatar, Arabs In Aspic and Pixie Ninja.
