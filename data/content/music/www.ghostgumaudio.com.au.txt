Sure the best equipment is an advantage, but you can't beat a great recording space. At Ghostgum Audio we've set out to combine top class recording spaces with access to the best technology. And that means we can record anything from a solo instrument or voice, up to 76 piece ensembles. ©Ghostgum Audio 2007. An initiative of Cannon Hill Anglican College, Brisbane.
