The organization has existed since 1993. It was formed in Cheshire, but we accept residents of any neighboring towns. We welcome all interested players to try us out. We are especially in need of: clarinets, french horns, low brass, baritone sax, and percussion at this time. Take a look at our repertoire and see the wide variety of music we play. Play with us for a year and you will notice that you are a better musician. What do we do? The Cheshire Community Band plays a number of concerts throughout the year. We perform for civic functions such as the Memorial Day ceremonies and the Strawberry Festival. We also provide entertainment at assisted living and retirement facilities. When are your Concerts? To minimize schedule conflicts, our concerts usually replace one of our rehearsals, i.e. on Wednesday nights. We also may have events on weekend afternoons or evenings.
