burginguitars.co.nz | Fine handcrafted guitars for the connoisseur #branding #masthead #header Welcome to Burgin Guitars I handcraft acoustic guitars, Weissenborn style guitars, Irish bouzoukis and citterns at my workshop in Wellington , New Zealand (Aotearoa) . My instruments are played world wide by musicians such as Dan Spitz (Anthrax),   Henry Kaiser , David Lindley , Mark Seymour  (Hunters and Collectors), l ilt , Barefoot Truth , Fred Kinbom , Lloyd Thayer ,  and  Al Billings  in Texas.  At Burgin Guitars we go all out to get our instruments made on time and within the agreed budget. Usual waiting time can be a couple of months, and mostly – no deposits (unless it’s something really different). We send pics of the build and can chat any time too – I’m at paddyburgin@gmail.com or via facebook. I have played music all my life and have been making instruments more than twenty years. I have exhibited at guitar shows in Montreal, Healdsburg, and Newport, Rhode Island. If you can get to a David Lindley concert, chances are he’ll have at least one of his Burgintwangers on stage. My instruments and some discussions about them are also on Facebook here.     .entry-content Comments are closed. #comments #content #container MENU MENU Home Page Instruments Weissenborn Bouzouki / Cittern Mandolins Other Guitars Harps Now in Stock Recordings Gentle Landings Ballyscully Live My Sweet Town Second Life The Dunstan Rangers, Unhugged Gone by lunchtime Videos Donna Dean Blackwood Bay Jesus on the Mainline Crete Aroha 2 Dan Spitz Guitar Course Biography Workbench Proverbs Customer Feedback Contact & Shipping Links #primary .widget-area #main Search Search for: #first .widget-area Contact PADDYBURGIN@GMAIL.COM  : +64 4 384 5572 : WELLINGTON : NEW ZEALAND #second .widget-area #footer-widget-area #colophon #footer #wrapper ngg_resource_manager_marker
