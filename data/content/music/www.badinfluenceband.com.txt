Well that is what Bad Influence has created with "Got What You Need," their latest disc". This new disc features a mix of original and favorite classics that we've been playing for years. Order it NOW! What the critics say.. “This Mid-Atlantic blues band has what it takes to be a great band. They write great new songs.
