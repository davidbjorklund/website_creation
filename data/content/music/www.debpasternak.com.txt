Artistically, Deb is defined only by her instruments - guitar and voice. Her music itself is a micro-encyclopedia of styles; reflecting an intelligence infused with a range of traditions. And while the traditions on which she bases her music are familiar to us all, Pasternak is her own musician - trademarked by her own sound. Pasternak's reputation precedes her. Her music is lovely, it is compelling, it is powerful. Listen to the recordings. Read the lyrics.
