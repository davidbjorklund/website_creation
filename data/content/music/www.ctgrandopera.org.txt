That is because we are here to talk about the different website builders available for you and what will be the pros and cons of your specific business. We will discuss the benefits of sites like ClickFunnels that are popular and even discuss the clickfunnels pricing options. Keep reading to learn the different website builders and why you should choose the one you are.  
 
The first point we want to talk about when it comes to ClickFunnels is that it ultimately saves you money. That means instead of paying for a sales funnel, different landing pages, a developer, a designer, a copywriter, and 10 other parts of your funnel, you are instead just paying for one item with ClickFunnels and it is very user-friendly so you can even do that yourself. ClickFunnels costs about $99 per month and it includes all of this. That means, in the end, it will ultimately save you money even if you may think that $99 per month seems like a lot of money, all the rest of the costs can really add up. 
 
The next part with ClickFunnels we want to talk about is that automates your sales process. It makes sales so much easier because it uses funnels that are proven to perform. You simply drop your content in and the magic begins. With business, you want things that work to be as automated as possible. This leaves less room for you to test what is working and less effort on your part. This is a huge perk with ClickFunnels. 
 
If you are looking for an overall great experience ClickFunnels is a great way to go since it will allow you to make changes along with the without needing to understand coding. Coding can be very overwhelming, especially if you don’t understand it. That means you need to hire someone for your business just for that task. Not anymore with ClickFunnels. As your business grows you can always hire someone to take over working the entire ClickFunnel, but you can always rest assured that you can jump in and make the necessary changes if you need to. 
 
The next great website builder we are going to talk about is WordPress. We wanted to talk extra about ClickFunnels because there are so many different parts about the funnel that you can add in. With WordPress, it is the most popular website builder if you are looking for a website. It does have coding which can be a good and a bad thing. The good thing about this is it means your webpage can do exactly what you want it to and it can end up looking completely unique.

With ClickFunnels, your layover may look very similar to many others. The negative part about having to code is simply you need to know how to do it. If you don’t, you will need to hire someone to get what you are looking for. With that said, you don’t need to be able to code with WordPress. It still has many template options where you can type your information or upload a photo into it. WordPress starts at just $99 per year plus you purchase a domain. If you have a specific theme or plugin, some may cost extra either per month or per year. Another positive to using Clickfunnels is their support team. It’s phenomenal! If you need to get in touch with them via social media there’s even a clickfunnels facebook support channel to reach them at! 

 
These are not the only website builders out there. For what people are looking for, these are the two most popular that we recommend. Some other noteworthy mentions are below. 
 
Wix
Wix is popular because it is probably the most simple of all website builders. The negative part about it is that it won’t have as much potential to rank high on search engine optimization (SEO). It also may run slightly slower than a website builder like WordPress. With that said, Wix is very user-friendly. You simply use your own photos or it has thousands you can use for free. It has easy to follow templates and you can create a website in just a couple of hours. If you are looking for the easiest website to build, Wix is a great option. 
 
Squarespace
Squarespace is a step up from Wix but it is still very easy to use. It does not involve any coding and it is known for its drag and drop method. It has a lot of different templates to choose from and it makes great eye-catching websites. 
 
GoDaddy
The final choice is a very user-friendly option. If you have purchased your domain from GoDaddy, you typically get an offer for creating your website through them too. This is great if you are in a rush and feel uncomfortable with bringing a domain over to another website. GoDaddy is similar to Wix in that it is user-friendly however it does not have nearly as many template options so it will look similar to another GoDaddy websites out there. 
 
As you can see, there are so many different website builders to choose from. Depending on your needs, you will be able to find a website builder that you feel comfortable within no time. Our experts are trained in building websites and building you exactly what you are looking for. To learn more, contact us today.

What Was The Earth Like When Dinosaurs Lived?
 
It is a scientifically proven fact, the Earth was vastly different many years ago. During this time, the Earth underwent many changes including its inhabitants. Once there were incredibly large animals now called dinosaurs, that reigned in the world. There were many different types of dinosaurs, many of the distant ancestors of the animals that walk the Earth today. For some of today’s animals, this relationship seems far removed, but for others, it is obvious. Some examples on both sides of this include alligators and crocodiles as well as sparrows and house cats. When you look at an alligator or a crocodile, it is easy to picture them as dinosaurs, They are bog and scally and they pack a powerful bite. On the other side of the equation, it is often quite difficult to compare a sparrow to prehistoric creatures. Also, consider the average house cat; it is quite difficult to imagine Tom as a Saber Tooth Tiger. Also, during the time of the dinosaurs, there were no diseases to worry about which meant that creatures lived to be incredibly old, especially when compared to the average life spans of animals now. Not only did they live an incredibly long time, but they also continued to grow. Creatures that incredibly tiny, could once be quite large. Take the insect known as a wooly worm. Now, it is quite small, measuring only one, maybe two inches. In the days of the dinosaurs, this same creature could grow to become larger than a small dog. The thought of a wooly worm the size of a Jack Russell Terrier is quite daunting. Here, you will learn about some of the ways the Earth was different during the dinosaur’s reign.
 
While there were many differences to earth during the time of dinosaurs, there are also many factors to consider in these differences. One of the biggest differences is that there was no pollution, no smog, no air pollution. The atmosphere was not damaged and the air was cleaner. The world was in perfect balance so to speak. This was a time before humans began to damage the Earth irreparably. No one was cutting down trees, trash was not being thrown in bodies of water. The Earth was healthier and more vibrant. Vegetation was plentiful and vibrant. It was an even more beautiful world. Imagine the dense forests, the clear sky, the bright sun. Imagine the polar ice caps and their most dense and significant. Imagine a place where everything was more pure, more vibrant.
 
So, when did dinosaurs live is a great question! It was many millions of years ago during the Mesozoic era. This era spent many years and is broken down into three periods; the Jurassic, the Triassic, and the Cretaceous. Each of these periods was a bit different and are marked by different occurrences. For example, scientists believe that it was during the Triassic period that the continents began to break apart. It is difficult to imagine a time when the continents were not separate with oceans between them.
However, according to studies, they were all joined together during the Jurassic period. 

 
The word “Jurassic” was made famous by a popular book that was turned into an even more popular series of movies, Jurassic Park. This story is, of course, fiction, but it gives people a look at what it would be like to be surrounded by dinosaurs. In this story, scientists found a way to extract dinosaur DNA from mosquitoes preserved in amber. There were then able to replicate the DNA and create a living, breathing dinosaurs. These dinos were used to create a park where people could spend the day looking at the dinosaurs much the same way people go to zoos. The herbivores were allowed to roam freely and the carnivores were contained inside of electric fences in a completely different part of the park which covered an entire island. In the story, this worked well for a long time, but eventually, a chain of events began that led to the carnivores being released and chaos ensued. The park gave the world the chance to see what it would have been like all of those millions of years ago, but it was only a minimal experience due to the zoo like structure. When the carnivores are released, it becomes more natural, but it is not until the next movie when humans must return to the island only to find it has become a completely natural home to dinosaurs. Each species took over the area of the island closest to their natural habitat and the mechanics of the park were overtaken by vegetation. This is the best look you will find in these movies of a representation of the time of the dinosaurs.
 
There are ways that people can get just a small dose of what it must have been like. Although, none are so immersive as a Jurassic Park. There are events that people of all ages attend that provide a dinosaur experience. At these events, you will be able to see replicas of various dinosaurs. Some of these are essentially statues while others are robotic. Some are even life-sized. There is often a show to watch the includes various “baby dinos”. Some are able to run around on their own while others must be operated while a person holds them. Other exhibits often include a few large,   adult dinos the move their heads and sometimes even walk. One event even has dinos that children can ride on. This is as close as you can get in real life to walking with dinosaurs, and many people find the experience to be something amazing and unforgettable. There are several of these events and they travel to different areas all of the time if you are interested in experience a little of what it would be like to walk with dinosaurs, look for one in your area. All it takes is a quick internet search with a location to search in and keywords such as “dinosaur event”.

Dental Treatments For TMJ Disorder
Dental work is vital to maintaining a healthy mouth, but few people know that this extends into the treatment of TMJ disorder. The acronym TMJ stands for temporomandibular joint. When something causes any part of this joint, muscles, tendons, ligaments, or the joint itself suffer any type of damage, it is referred to as TMJ disorder. The temporomandibular joint controls the opening and closing the mouth, chewing, and a great deal of speaking. When something affects any of these things, it can have a major impact on everyday life. TMJ disorder is actually quite common, partly due to the fact that it can be caused by so many different things. Several causes, such as teeth grinding and misalignment can be rectified by visiting a dentist and receiving the proper treatment. TMJ disorder is a painful disorder that often requires taking pain relievers on a regular basis. Sometimes it is over the counter medications such as Advil and other times it requires prescription strength medication. Thankfully, there are treatments available that will remedy the cause of TMJ disorder and alleviate the pain and other symptoms. Here, you will learn about some of the methods of treatment currently available through dentists.
 
It is important to stress the fact that there are numerous ways to develop TMJ disorder. To successfully treat this disorder, you have to treat the underlying cause, which means that the first step to treatment will be to determine the cause. Only certain causes can be treated by a dentist, other causes will need to be treated by the appropriate specialist. If you are not sure what is causing your TMJ pain, it is best to start by seeing your primary care physician to get a proper diagnosis. Often times, all it takes is one visit to get a diagnosis, but there are also times when tests may need to be run in order to understand what is going on. If you do find yourself in the position of needing tests to determine the cause of your TMJ disorder, it is important to remain calm. Requiring tests does not mean that something terrible is wrong, it simply means that the doctor needs more information about your body before they can understand what is wrong. If you are having pain in your TMJ, even if you have never had problems before, see a doctor as soon as possible. 
 
To make an important determination whether or not you need to see a doctor, it is important to understand as much as possible about the TMJ. This does not mean that you need to start studying medical books, a bit of basic information is all that is needed. First of all, it is all well and good to talk about the TMJ and refer to the jaw, but do you know where the TMJ is? The majority of people have two temporomandibular joints, one on each side of the jaw. These joints are what hold the jaw on the rest of the skull. Next, it is important to understand some of the most common causes of TMJ. While there are a great many different ways to develop TMJ disorder, there are some that are by far more common than others. This includes an injury, grinding or clenching your teeth, misaligned teeth, a misaligned jaw, and arthritis.

There are different treatments for each of these including everything from TMJ exercises to surgery.

 
Now, consider the different treatments that a dentist can provide. Grinding and clenching your teeth is not only one of the most common causes of TMJ disorder, but it is also one of the easiest to treat. Your dentist will fit you with a bite guard that will relieve some of that undue pressure that you are putting on both your jaw and your teeth. Not only will this help with the TMJ disorder, it will also protect your teeth from serious damage. This is an incredibly simple process, one that your dentist will be able to complete quickly and easily while taking you through each step. Of course, it is important to note that teeth clenching is generally a sign of stress which means that you will need to address this to fully deal with your TMJ disorder. While the bite guard will ease the pain and protect from further damage, it cannot help with the underlying issue of stress. So long as you remain at that stress level, you will continue clenching your teeth. Even if you are protected with a bite guard, clenching is still bad for the jaw. There are several ways to combat stress, Ideally, you will be able to remove whatever is causing the stress from your life, but this is not always an option. For those times, deep breathing is often very helpful. If the problem is severe enough, consider seeking the aid of a psychologist.
 
If your  TMJ disorder is being caused by misaligned teeth, braces are often the answer. It will take time from braces to fully solve the problem, but once the treatment is complete, you will not have to worry about TMJ disorder anymore. If you think that your problem might stem from misaligned teeth, make an appointment with your dentist right away. They will be able to examine your teeth and determine if there is misalignment and if so, how severe it is. If it is determined that you need braces to correct a severe misalignment, your dentist will refer you to an orthodontist right away, there may even be one within the dental office you already use. 
 
An injury is another common cause of tmj disorder and there are certain instances where a dentist might prove helpful. For example, if an injury caused a tooth to become damaged severely, it will have an impact of the entire mouth system, including the TMJ. When this is the case, visiting a dentist will help some, perhaps even all of your problem. If the injury is strictly within the jaw or directly to the TMJ, you will need to see a specialist other than a dentist, but if you are unsure of the damage, a dentist can help you narrow it down.

What Makes A Great Dentist?
Choosing a dentist, or any other medical professional often seems like a difficult and frightening task. Even small areas often have several offices to choose from for general practitioners, dentists, and ophthalmologists. This means more pressure to choose the best one. This is not to say that they are not all excellent choices, only that one will be better for you than the rest. Each one will have features that the others do not. This can include different office hours, pediatric specialists, or any other contributing factor that is important to you for any reason. There are certain aspects that tend to be important for the majority of people and this is what will be discussed here. There will be a list of the most common requirements and what to look for in a dentist specifically.
The first thing most people consider is proximity. As a general rule, people do not want to travel a long distance to visit any type of medical professional, especially when there is a chance of undergoing a procedure. Visiting a dentist provides the biggest chance of this. Of course, the procedure is generally scheduled for another day, there is still the worry of determining the necessity of a procedure. Also, if you are taking a child to a dentist visit, a long trip is even less desirable. This means that the most desirable option is often the closest one. When determining exactly what you want out of a dentist, you must determine exactly how far away you are willing to travel. The best way to find out how many offices are in the vicinity of your location is to search the internet. To do this you will need to use specific location descriptors in your search. A good example of this is “dentist in Midtown NYC”. This will give you specific results for your location.
Next, many people worry about whether or not a particular dental office will accept their insurance. Dental procedures are always on the expensive side which means that the majority of the population cannot afford to have them done without the aid of their insurance. Unfortunately, not all dental offices accept all types of insurance. This is why it is vital to determine if a specific office accepts your insurance prior to making an appointment. There are two ways to get this information. You can either check directly with the dental office or you can check with your insurance provider. Within these two options, rests on two possible methods. The first option is to call either place. The dental office secretary or the customer service section at your insurance company will be able to provide you with the information that you need. The other option is to scour the websites of the companies for the information. Generally speaking, dental offices will have a section on their website dedicated to listing all of the types of insurance that they accept. Not every dental office will do this, but it will not take much of your time to check. Also, most insurance companies list all of the offices that they cover in a specified region.


The next important factor is a quality often referred to as “bedside manner”. If you are not familiar with this phrase, it is a direct reference to the way a doctor interacts with their patients. Are they blunt? Are they kind? Do they take time to answer your questions and reassure you? All of these questions and more need to be answered for most people to feel comfortable with a medical professional of any kind. If a doctor is too brusk, too blunt, it can make the patient uncomfortable and on edge. Also, if a doctor never seems to have the time to answer your questions or take time with you in general, it provides an immediate lack of confidence. This is why many people choose to set up a “trial” appointment. In relation to a dentist, this is often either a basic checkup or a teeth cleaning. This will give you a chance to see how well the dentist interacts with you and what their bedside manner is like. A trial run so to speak. If you do not like the dentist, for any reason, you have the opportunity to move on to another one. Keep in mind though, that your insurance is not likely to pay for multiple appointments back to back. Therefore, do not begin this stage until you have narrowed your list of possibilities to one or two options.
Next, consider office hours. Not everyone keeps the same hours during the day which means that not everyone can conform to the same available office hours. Many offices offer the same hours, eight in the morning to five in the evening. This does not work for everyone which is why some offices have extended or alternative hours. Depending on your needs, this may be one of the primary deciding factors. It is vital to find a dentist that will work with your schedule. This is and of itself takes a great deal of stress off of your shoulders.
The last consideration we are going to discuss here is only relevant to part of the population that will be seeking a dentist. This consideration is children. Parents are faced with two options. One, they can use a separate pediatric dentist for their child or two, they can find a family dentist that will see both children and adults. This often plays a big part when a parent has to choose a new dentist. Either way, it is important to find a dentist for your children and whether you are looking for a separate one or not, that dentist must be very good with kids. They must know how to handle a child’s fears and find ways to keep them calm. Also, it is important to have a certain level of trust in your child’s dentist. In a world where it is difficult to trust strangers, you must find a dentist that you can build a professional relationship with one you can trust.
