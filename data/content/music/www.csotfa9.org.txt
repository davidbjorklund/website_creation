Our members’ ages range from very young to the very young at heart. Our common bond? A love for traditional acoustic music, and the desire to play it and pass it on to future generations. Although fiddles always rule, we gladly invite toe-tappers and players of other acoustic instruments to come out and join us. Come out and meet us at the next jam! Please Like our Facebook page!
