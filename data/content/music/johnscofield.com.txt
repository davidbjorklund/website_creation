Everyone in the group lives in and around the historic Hudson Valley, north of New York City. Inspired by the beauty and environmental fragility of the region, their album offers Scofield and DeJohnette originals, alongside inspired readings of Dylan, Hendrix, The Band, and Joni Mitchell. Jazz, rock, soul, and other influences commingle. The soloing is deep, but it’s their confluence of piano/organ, gritty electric guitar, and acoustic rhythm section that makes  Hudson  unique. The album is available for purchase everywhere . .post-inner .post excerpt .post-box Country for Old Men Release Date .header John Scofield’s latest album Country for Old Men  was released September 23, 2016!
