PRIVATE MUSIC LESSONS There is a big difference between what we offer and what you'll find elsewhere. We have been teaching lessons and band classes since 1998; teaching our students what they need to know to get the full benefits of playing an instrument. Lessons at AASMC are tailored to the individual goals, interests, and learning style of each student. While every student needs to know the same universal language of music, how you get there is different for everyone. We feel strongly that the "fun" part of learning an instrument comes when one feels the reward of accomplishment. Don't kid yourself that beginners don't need quality lessons. Learning the correct techniques from the start prevents a lot of work later, undoing bad habits. MORE INFO BAND CLASSES ​ OUR ROCK BAND PROGRAM Rock Band School is our version of a team sport, only with guitars and drums. The best way to learn an instrument is to apply the skills and concepts learned in private lessons. Once our students have a firm grasp on the basics of guitar, bass, drums, violin, or keyboards, Rock Band School is the next step. It’s a great motivator to help take a student’s playing to the next level.
