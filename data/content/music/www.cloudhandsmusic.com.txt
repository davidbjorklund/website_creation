[[/center]] About Peter Ross Peter Ross is a shakuhachi teacher, performer, flute-maker, and recording artist currently living in San Miguel de Allende, Mexico.  He began his studies with F.K. Nagao sensei in 1972 in Hawaii.  While living there, he began making shakuhachi flutes out of bamboo and also teaching at Hilo Community College. In 1976, Peter began studying with Masayuki Koga in San Francisco. When Masayuki Koga moved from San Francisco to the Zen center in Minneapolis, Peter moved there with his family.  There he began to make lathe-turned wooden shakuhachi.  He decided to make flutes from quality hardwoods, such as rosewood and cocobolo.  Peter was the first flute maker outside of Japan to make hardwood shakuhachi.  During his fourteen-year stay in Minneapolis, besides teaching shakuhachi, Peter performed for several years at a well-known Japanese restaurant. [[br]] Peter Ross now imports high end, hand crafted shakuhachi flutes, crafted by several master shakuhachi makers that he visited while in Japan in 1998. More recently Peter has studied with Ray Brooks, Teruo Furuya, Marco Leinhard, and Akikazu Nakamura. Since 1975, Peter has been very active as a shakuhachi performer, teacher, recording artist and flute maker. He has taught and performed in Hawaii, California, Minneapolis, Seattle, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Peter is taking a break (possibly permanently) from flute making to concentrate on performing, recording and teaching shakuhachi. As a player, Peter brings his uniquely innovative style to the shakuhachi. He plays with great feeling and creativity.  Strongly influenced by jazz, Peter uses his improvisational skills to transcend traditional shakuhachi playing styles.  His playing has appeared on soundtracks for both film and television.   Contact Information     Site revised  31/7/2010
