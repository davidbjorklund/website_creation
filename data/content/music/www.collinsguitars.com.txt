By working with high-quality woods, time-tested processes, and a deep understanding of the science of sound, we have unlocked some of the brightest and richest sounds you can get from a guitar.  From day one, you will understand the difference.  By day 100, you won't be able to put it down.  All guitars sound better with age.  Ours sound best.
