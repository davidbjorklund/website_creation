Early jazz originated as dance music and was influenced both by the existing dance music as well as the orchestras of the late 19th and early 20th century. Jazz’s musical heritage was mostly European, which became increasingly influenced by the American Negro music that augmented it. The dance orchestra became enlarged from the ‘Quadrille Orchestra’ (violin, flute, clarinet, trumpet & string, bass) into what was called the ‘Society Orchestra’ or ‘String Band — adding trombone, piano, trap drums and later, saxophones.
