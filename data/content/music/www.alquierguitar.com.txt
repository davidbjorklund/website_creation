The easy-to-play guitars are made with bamboo, non-tropical wood and non-toxic metals—notably titanium. Acclaimed luthier Jean-Yves Alquier is the driving force behind Alquier Guitars. The idea is simple. Build exceptional instruments while respecting the environment. Alquier is notorious for his visionary designs. In 2015, the president of France awarded Alquier the prestigious MOF (best craftsmen in his industry). Alquier researched new ways to work bamboo as a quality alternative to banned tropical wood. To take his designs to the next level, Alquier joined forces with entrepreneur Jean-François Azam and Nicolas Mercadal, who produces remarkable pickups. The nascent Alquier Guitars launched its first collection, the eco-friendly Ethiq, at the 2018 NAMM Show. Production started in April 2018 at its new facility in Rivesaltes, France. A spirited and experienced team, with the latest tech, drives production. Based on “French excellence,” Alquier Guitars serves the desires of the hard-core guitar community. The company is committed to the ongoing process of creation and a culture of quality. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section .entry-content .et_pb_post #main-content .et_pb_column Contact 40 rue Jean Jaures 66600 Rivesaltes France +33.4.68.51.39.35 info@alquierguitars.com .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Follow .et_pb_text Follow Follow Follow Follow .et_pb_counters Search for: .et_pb_text Privacy Policy Cookie Policy .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section end .fwidget end .footer-widget #footer-widgets .container Designed by DefRef .container #main-footer #et-main-area #page-container Français
