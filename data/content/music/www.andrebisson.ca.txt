What people are saying
  “With a title like Left With the Blues, that’s what I was expecting to pull from this batch of songs, but there is so much going on here I was delighted as each track  grabbed me and took on some really cool, unexpected side trips. This is a perfect album”.

John the Rock Doctor Kereiff
