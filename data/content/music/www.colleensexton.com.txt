Greatest Find "Acoustically lush yet gently twangy, 'Find' is rich with hip harmonies and wisecracking homilies. With a snappy yet carefree back up, Colleen discovers strong roots in a novel combination of bendable folk, sugar-free pop and unplugged jazz." -- Maximum Ink "[ Greatest Find is] Sexton's finest effort yet. 'Benediction' is a stunning new original that soars on the strength of Sexton's impressive vocals, while 'Mean Streak' is a delicate and drop-dead gorgeous affair." -- Burlington Free Press     home contact tour bio & pics mailing list & discussion store links press credits
