Q: For me, the basics of music are something I feel that I have developed. I both understand and can play lot's of; chords, scales and arpeggios. My problem however, is this; when I am composing, what music theory say's is technically correct hardly ever sounds good to me. Could you make a lesson that covers how to compose with more of a practical approach to theory, independent of all of the technical sides of music-theory. I don't want to abandon music theory, just begin working in a way that doesn't have me critically dependent upon theory all of the time. - Thomas, Tampa, Florida. A: When I teach composing, I always stress that one of the very first things to learn is how to build on a theme. Theme's are melodic hooks that create a coherence in a phrase. There are many ways to build a theme, but the most basic way is to repeat something to create a form of melodic or harmonic identification for the listener.
