Milt Briggs Milt Briggs Milt Briggs: Home Welcome So glad you could visit the new website. This is a place where you will discover how I became a maverick whistler and how I now have several complete shows to entertain folks of all ages. I love to entertain you with my whistle and singing as I accompany myself with the guitar, keyboard or piano. Some of the songs are my own compositions. I've written over 75 numbers. You can also get contact info here to book gigs or buy cds. Â© 2015 Milt Briggs
