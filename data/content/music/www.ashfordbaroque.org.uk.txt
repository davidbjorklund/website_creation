We aim for an authentic playing style, and we do sometimes tune down a semitone to Baroque pitch - for example when we have music for strings only, or when Baroque wind instruments are available. We generally play music from about 1600-1785, from late Renaissance pieces at one end to early Classical at the other, including music by Haydn & Mozart. In most concerts we perform trio sonatas or other smaller scale works as well as concertos and sinfonias, and from time to time include vocal and choral music, to provide our audiences - and players - with plenty of variety. Many of our players play to concerto standard, so we do not normally employ paid soloists from outside the ensemble. About our Director: Philip Buckmaster gained an honours degree at the Colchester Institute School of Music, where Peter Holman (of The Parley of Instruments ) was the resident early music lecturer. He studied the organ, piano, harpsichord, violin, singing, composing and conducting. He then followed a specialist course for music teachers at Kingston University and now enjoys a varied career in and around London, playing, teaching, directing, composing and arranging. He has always had a keen interest in Baroque music and its performance. Well known locally, he is also Director of Music at St Matthew's Church, Ashford , and was Conductor of Feltham Choral Society from 1991 to 2016.

Would you like us to come and perform in your church or other venue? We have our own music stands and harpsichord. All we require is chairs (without arms) and space for about 15-20 players to be seated, and a fee of £300. Occasionally this amount is exceeded if extra players need to be brought in for any special works you might want us to play, or if your venue is far away. Any amount you raise above this you can use how you wish. We suggest a ticket price of £7-10 for a concert, which means that after the first 30-43 people, you make a profit! Do you need an accompaniment for your choir? We are also available to choirs seeking an historically informed Baroque accompaniment at modern or Baroque pitch. (A=415, ie. a semitone lower) Fees are negotiable. We also play music from the Classical period on modern instruments, so you can include a more varied programme in your concert. However, please note that it is impractical to play at different pitches within the same concert, so if Baroque instruments are desired, the whole concert needs to be at A415.     Players' Resources For new or visiting players - view or download directions to St Matthew's Church.
