Al Fuller- Entertainer! Home Page Al Fuller Musician, Singer, Songwriter, music instructor                 ...to Al Fuller's website. Al has been singing, playing, and composing music for most of his life. He was raised in Western Massachusetts Pioneer Valley. His mother was a piano teacher, and taught him to play the piano as soon as he was big enough to sit on the piano stool. But at age 12, when his mother brought home a guitar from a yard sale, it was love at first sight. Al studied privately through his teens, and after graduating from the University of Massachusetts, he hit the road. A veteran performer, Al entertained troops in Viet Nam, and played in England, Spain, Canada, Mexico, and all over the United States. Entertainer, Guitar, Harmonica, Singer, Songwriter.....these are what Al lists as his occupation on his business card. But that doesn't tell you about the dynamic quality of his entertainment, singing, and guitar playing. Phil Colpas from the Pelican Press heaps praise on Al's style saying, "At nearly six and a half feet, Al Fuller attracts attention for being tall, but it's his music that stands head and shoulders above the rest". His fine, bluesy baritone voice reels out tune after tune with precision, while accompanying himself on a Gibson 6-string, a Fender Stratocaster, a National Resophonic Guitar, assorted harmonicas, and some fancy footwork.   Link here to Al Fuller's Electronic Press Kit....   Al Fuller's Latest Solo CD Entitled "Coming Home"     "How Far" was recorded solo by Al Fuller, in 1987, and is now available on CD   You can see all of Al Fuller's CD's by linking here.           Learn how you can add a pick up to your resonator guitar!   ABOUT AL | MUSIC LESSONS | BUY CDS | CALENDAR | LISTEN | PRESS KIT | CONTACT US © Copyright VELVET HAMMER PRODUCTIONS .
