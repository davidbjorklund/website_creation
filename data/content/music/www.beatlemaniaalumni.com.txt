Beatlemania Alumni, The Casts, The Music, The Magic   WELCOME!!!  Like us, many other fans often wonder  "what ever happened to"  the fine musicians from this musical tribute that ran on and off Broadway and internationally from 1977 until 1984. Many of those musicians still perform today,  keeping the spirit and music of  the Beatles alive for fans all over the world to experience and enjoy. This site's goal is to chronicle the past and present achievements of the cast members of BEATLEMANIA. If you would like to contribute or know any of the alumni, please let them know about this site. We would love to hear from them and post their favorite stories and photos.  ENTER Contact: Beatlemaniac@BeatlemaniaAlumni.com   YEAH, YEAH, YEAH!!!
