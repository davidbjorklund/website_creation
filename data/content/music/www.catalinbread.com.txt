AVAILABLE EARLY SPRING 2019 $ 229.99 PRODUCT MANUAL Add to Cart Find Nearest Retailer Online Retailers Coriolis ™ Effect A sustainer, wah, filter, pitch shifter, and harmonizer rolled into one The Coriolis™ Effect is a phenomenon in classical mechanics where a trajectory becomes altered due to a rotating frame of reference. The Catalinbread® Coriolis™ Effect has three main parameters to change the equations of motion for your guitar signal. Turning down the Velocity and Acceleration controls drags your playing into the heart of a black hole, redshifting your tone into a lower pitch and filtering out the high frequencies. The Hold button will instantly pull you into the black hole stopping time completely. Plug in and explore where humanity has never shredded before! In short: Think of the Coriolis™ Effect as a sustainer, wah, filter, pitch shifter, and harmonizer rolled into one—the sonic possibilities are endless!
