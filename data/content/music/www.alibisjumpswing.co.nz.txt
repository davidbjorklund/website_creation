The Alibis "jump swing band" The Alibis... Their classy, horn-driven swing music and jump blues appeals to music lovers and dancers alike. The Alibis' sound has been influenced by swing and jump blues combos from the 1950s rhythm and blues era and the neo-swing revival of the late 1990s. "[The Alibis] sensibly avoid the over-familiar tunes in this 50s-style of jazz-pop (mercifully no Louis Jordan overkill) and keep the music tight'n'tidy... Jump blues is good-time music and they sound like they are having a good time doing it."  Graham Reid, NZ Herald , Available now the Alibis second CD "ON THE ROCKS" Album review by NZ Musician Magazine Click Here To obtain your copy email: thealibis@hotmail.com You can contact us via Email:- thealibis@hotmail.com Click here to get the Alibis pubkit (pdf format)
