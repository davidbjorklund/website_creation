Their all-acoustic performances consist of guitars, banjo, mandolin, upright bass, and of course the trademark rich blend of their four voices. An evening with this quartet is an unforgettable time of pure, acoustic music and entertainment. Musical million-sellers for The Brothers Four include "Greenfields," "Yellow Bird," "Try to Remember," and "Across the Wide Missouri." And their hit recording of "The Green Leaves of Summer" from the motion picture "The Alamo," was nominated for an Academy Award. The current lineup includes: Mike McCoy, a veteran folk performer and singer/songwriter who has performed with The Brothers Four on special recording projects and occasional stage presentations since the late 1960's; Washington native, Karl Olsen, a folk performer, choral director and writer and arranger; Washington State's Mark Pearson, guitarist, banjo player extraordinaire and singer/songwriter who has been such a strong and consistent part of the Group's signature sound since he originally joined in the late 1960's; and Founding Member and Seattle native, Bob Flick, bass player, group leader and singer/songwriter.
