(updated 11/16/17) .entry-header   *updated 11/16/17* HQ pics of Vanessa-Mae’s birthday card birthday card (both sides) back of Vanessa’s birthday card front of Vanessa’s birthday card Scroll down to see the questions submitted to Vanessa-Mae. In preparation for Vanessa-Mae’s birthday … Vanessa-Mae practices a duet with her mother Pamela Vanessa-Mae’s birthday is a little over two months from now.  She was born on October 27, 1978.  Here’s a little fun fact, did you know  Niccolo Paganini was also born on that same day?  Vanessa has often stated Paganini is her favorite composer. As a tradition, we send Vanessa questions asked by fans on the VMnet  forum  .  We have done this for the past 14 years, and she’s answered every single one!  Now I’m giving you the chance to ask your own question.  Remember though, I cannot guarantee that your question will be chosen.  We only send about six or seven questions total. How?  You must first register on the  forum  and then head over to the Vanessa’s birthday  thread  for details. We also send presents and this year’s will be very special.  The present itself is worth thousands of dollars and will be very unique.  I can’t wait to tell you more about it! ~Ben Update – 11/16/17 Here’s the message I sent to Vanessa-Mae on her birthday card: Dearest Vanessa-Mae, Happy 39th Birthday! We here at the VMnet forum wish that you had a very memorable birthday, spending time with loved ones and having lots of fun! All of us wish to thank you for the wonderful memories that you have given throughout your extraordinary career. We have a very special birthday present for you, but it’s not ready yet. Please stay tuned! 🙂 Of course we do have a few questions that we hope you’d be willing to answer: 1) What keeps you busy nowadays musically (in between concerts)? 2) Any news on a new album? If not, could you tell us what style(s) of music that it would encompass? 3) Your fans in the U.S. miss you! Do you plan on performing in the U.S. in the not-too-distant future? 4) During your concerts recently, We notice you’ve played some music we haven’t heard you play in quite some time.  For example, “Picante” and “I will always love you”. Do you plan to keep going back and performing pieces from your earlier work that you haven’t perform in quite a while? If so, we love the idea! Paganini’s “24th Caprice” and “Classical Gas”  come to mind … 🙂 5) Do you have a strict practice regiment you follow? When you practice, are there certain pieces that you like to play to keep yourself in shape? … and that’s it! Once again, thank you for your time and we look forward to hearing from you! -Benji Ivy Owner, vanessamae.net Lastly, her birthday present is still not ready yet.  I recommend you visit the forum’s birthday  thread  to stay informed. .entry-content Author Ben Posted on August 17, 2017 December 13, 2017 Categories Videos 7 Comments on Do you have a question for Vanessa-Mae on her birthday?

[updated 5/25/17] .entry-header Next stop: Bratislava Vanessa wows the crowd in her recent visit to Bratislava Vanessa-Mae is continuing her tour she started back in February.  This time, she plays two concerts in Bratislava just a few days ago.  Right now, there has not been much footage uploaded of the concert.  However, I included what I did find below.  I will continue to update this page as more videos become available. She looks great as always, and once again wears a beautiful pink dress.  It seems like the same one she wore at her Valentine’s Day concert.  She did wear another dress, but the footage is quite grainy.  Unfortunately, I am not able to tell much as the fan who recorded it was quite far from the stage. May will be a busy month for Vanessa-Mae!  She has concerts planned in Macedonia, Israel and Poland all before month’s end.  As a result, you can expect to be seeing more footage from these appearances.

It is obvious that the audience enjoyed these concerts.  Again, Vanessa-Mae mixes things up when she visits Russia.  Consequently, no two visits are the same, which I appreciate highly.  Hopefully,  CrazyCat  was able to attend! This fan has recorded entire concerts at Crocus City Hall for past 4 years. I will continue to update this page as more footage becomes available.  Furthermore, if you find anything that is not listed here, please reach out to me on the  forum .  I would love to hear from you! ***Update*** Photos of Vanessa’s concert at the Crocus City Hall are available on their  site .  It seems that her concert had a Valentine’s Day theme, as she wore a gorgeous pink gown.  Furthermore, I noticed some audience members holding pink hearts made of paper.  Some of them even wave it back and forth during certain songs.  I’m very envious of the fans that were able to attend.  I hope she plans to come back to the U.S. some day!  Before I forget, let me thank  Display  for finding the above link.
