The Primitive Quartet has been traveling and singing gospel music fourty six years, and we count it a joy and privilege to spread the gospel through song. Our ultimate goal is to see saints blessed and encouraged to have a closer walk with God and to help lead souls to a saving knowledge of Jesus Christ. Our quartet was formed as a result of a fishing trip when we sat around the campfire at night and sang. We realized that we had four-part harmony, and from there we started singing at our home church and other local churches. Today we travel approximately fifty thousand miles a year and do about one hundred fifty dates annually. Our music is the traditional mountain shape note style singing accompanied by acoustical instruments including the mandolin, banjo, fiddle, guitars and acoustic bass. We play our own music on all our recordings and strive to duplicate the same sound on all our personal appearances. We would like to thank all of you who have supported us through the years by purchasing our products and attending our concerts. Without you, we could not be full-time servants. We also want to say, "Thank you" to all the DJ's who have played our music on the radio and the television hosts who have used our videos on your programs. While you are visiting us today, we invite you to check out our Products Page . Here you can view the song lists and listen to demos. Watch Great American Gospel and Great American Bluegrass . If you would like to come see us, please check out the Events Calendar . If we can be of any assistance, please drop us a line at pqinfo@primitivequartet.com . Again, thank you for visiting and God Bless.
