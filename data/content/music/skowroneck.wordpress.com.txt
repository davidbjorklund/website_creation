Tilman Skowroneck | harpsichord and early piano Tilman Skowroneck harpsichord and early piano first and last – 60 years (and a few) of skowroneck harpsichords March 11, 2019 © Tilman Skowroneck 2019 Just as I was writing that Martin Skowroneck’s unfinished harpsichord no. 90 now reaches completion in the Oldenburg workshop of Dietrich Hein (see also here ), Menno van Delft sent me pictures of the first Skowroneck harpsichord, which is on display in the Berlin instrument collection. (Photo: Menno van Delft 2019) So this is “no. 1”, a rather ambitious project with a 16′, 2x 8′, 4′ and buff stop, built in 1953. According to Martin Skowroneck ( Cembalobau; Harpsichord Construction  (Bergkirchen: Bochinsky, 2003), 261–62), this instrument is very globally based on a sketch of harpsichord no. 316 (known as “Bach-Cembalo” at the time) in the Berlin collection (which explains why it looks more or less historical in shape and especially, why it has this particular disposition). The inner construction is more or less modern (in want of better information at the time), with heavy frame members in ash, ribs under the bridge and a thin 4′ hitchpin rail. The boards for the case had to be prepared at a machine pool in Bremen, to be carried on foot across town for assembly in the basement of Skowroneck’s rented house in the Gravelottestraße. Knowing only this story, I was quite astonished to see such a neatly finished and gleaming harpsichord-shaped object on Menno’s photo! Fast forward sixty years, to harpsichord no. 90.

May 3, 2016 © Tilman Skowroneck 2016 The Westfield Center for Historical Keyboard Studies, in partnership with the 2016 Berkeley Festival & Exhibition, organises “Cembalophilia: Hidden Histories of the Harpsichord”, a mini-festival with concerts and lectures, which will take place in the Berkeley City Club June 6-8, 2016 (see also the poster below for more information; I will participate in the Tribute to Alan Curtis). I love the title “Cembalophilia.” Is this even a thing, one might wonder, and yes, be assured, it can be a thing. People do love good harpsichords and their repertoire, and good harpsichordists. Often they don’t even know it, however, which may be why we usually play for smaller audiences than we feel we should. But this is also why – as I may have written before – after a recital audience members always come forward and want to learn more about the harpsichord on stage. “I had no idea there was so much variation in this instrument!” we frequently hear at that point. Another recent harpsichord mini-festival in Göteborg, Sweden (see this entry)  has convinced me of two things: First, it is and remains worthwhile to invest energy, time (and money) in live events that showcase harpsichords and their players. A harpsichord is not just a historically appropriate choice for a given repertoire. A good harpsichord offers an astonishingly wide range of expressive possibilities; it can be a friend and ally to the player, and it can move audiences to tears. Second, all this needs to be said, and not only done by playing. Some people imagine that harpsichord lovers actually feel they need to defend   their instrument. But a fighty attitude is not what I have in mind here. Gone are the angry days, when the historical harpsichord had to battle against the revival harpsichord of a 20th-century design; and also the Bachian conflict between piano lovers and harpsichord lovers has become stale, mostly thanks to the great amount of excellent, serious and unfazed Bach players on both sides. The real “enemy” these days, it seems to me, is the audiences’ increasing loss of interest in live performances, which for our instrument especially is a sad thing: harpsichords do not sound very convincing out of a laptop speaker. So we must keep telling people that it is the laptop speaker that’s bad, not our instrument; that they should come to the next concert instead.

Further below are some sneak clips (music edits done, but perhaps not the ultimate final tonal balance). The recording was made by Herwin Troje. As always, please contact me for permission before sharing these links. The instrument, a little unexpectedly, is a one-manual brass-strung harpsichord after German originals, with a 392-415 keyboard. Temperaments used: a ‘French ordinaire’ variation and Rameau (which, really, is another ‘French ordinaire’ variation), at a=392Hz. The project was initiated by the instrument’s owner Bengt Nässén. Johann Jakob Froberger (1616—1667) Toccata VI in A minor Gigue Lamentation , faite sur la tres douloreuse Mort de Sa Majeste Imperiale, Ferdinand le Troisieme Louis Couperin (c. 1626—1661) Prélude in D minor Allemande Jean-Philippe Rameau (1683—1764) Prélude Tags: baroque , froberger , historical performance practice , louis couperin , rameau , recording , sweden Posted in classical music , early music , harpsichord , Music , performing arts | 3 Comments » « Older Entries Search: Pages Profile & Vita Continuo / harpsichord and fortepiano solo Lark & Robin translations Courses and teaching Harpsichord maintenance Publications / lectures / discography Reviews Pictures Sample Recordings Research Beethoven The Pianist errata Skowroneck harpsichords: sales Contact & booking Top Posts Skowroneck harpsichords: sales Publications / lectures / discography first and last - 60 years (and a few) of skowroneck harpsichords Research Blogroll David Pickett's blog Erik Sikkema's homepage Ibo Ortgies' homepage Jessica Skowroneck: fine art Lark & Robin translations Looking for my food blog?
