As President of our organization, Randy has provided the leadership for the Board that has resulted in many successful events, including The DC Bluegrass Festival, the Hazel Dickens Song Contest, and the Mike Auldridge Instrumental Contest. Over these years, DCBU has served members old and new, has attracted far-flung audiences to our festival and concerts, kept the music playing at our picnics, and coordinated the activities at the DCBU Bluegrass Week at Common Ground on the Hill Bluegrass and Old Time Music instructional camp. From the start, Randy has worked hard at growing the music community while keeping a focus on DC’s rich bluegrass heritage. As Randy steps down from DCBU’s Board of Directors, we salute his vision and dedication to improving the local bluegrass music community. Randy will remain active in the music community. Expect to find him and his banjo frequenting our events and leading our DCBU Bluegrass Week workshops at Common Ground on the Hill.
