I'm glad you are here, and I'm excited to share some of my work with you. We're in the midst of a campaign for my latest project, an album and companion book called Treasure in My Chest . Check out the video - I'd be hugely grateful to have you  help bring it to life . I hope you find my website easy-to-navigate whether you are a first-time visitor, or searching for something specific that you need in a hurry. Of course there is music here - stream any song from any CD or download, watch concert videos , and even read lyrics. If words are what you enjoy, there are Essays and shorter Blog posts , plus some of my poems as well. And of course, lots of tools to make the work of presenters, publicists and journalists as easy as possible. Have you ever been to a house concert ? Please let me know if you can't find what you need. If you like what you hear and see, please tell someone! There is no big entertainment conglomerate running this operation. For some 20 years now I've managed to coax a livelihood out of this life in music largely by word of mouth, hopefully by bringing my very best work to the stage and studio every time. I'm grateful to each and every person who has taken the time to turn others on to my work, or helped bring me to a stage or school in their community. I'd welcome your support - the best way to stay in touch is to subscribe to my monthly email newsletter (E-Zine), and you get a gift of 9 free songs just for signing up. Every page here is easily shareable by a variety of means. Here are some ways that you can join me , little and large. Most of all, thanks for visiting!   .entry #widget_region_post_content #content LET'S CONNECT! .widget_container .widget_social .widget-wrapper Tour Dates â 09/28/2019 Capon Bridge Fire Dept.
