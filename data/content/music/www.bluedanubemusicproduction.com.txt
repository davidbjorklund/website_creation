Being a classically trained multi-instrumentalist, arranger/programmer has led to his unique ability to work and feel at home in such entirely different musical environments and genres such as R'n'B, Pop, Rock, Classical, Dance, Hip Hop, Latin, Ethnic and Smooth Jazz, thus constantly opening the boundaries between different styles and widening and pushing the horizons of his production and songwriting work. His restless striving for perfection, his never-ending search for melodies and moods that pull the listener into the song, make his music not only an aural but also a visual experience. His way of interweaving pumping grooves with hypnotic and memorable melodies, combining computerized perfection with "controlled human imperfection" and sonically superior production quality has led to the creation of pieces of music that clearly stand out from the crowd in today´s music scene. On this site you´ll find information about Peter´s work, people he has collaborated with over the years, examples of songs in a variety of styles and some pictures to look at. We put this site up for you to get familiar with the unique talent of Peter Roberts. After all it´s all about the music. Look, Listen & Enjoy!   Thanks for stopping by!
