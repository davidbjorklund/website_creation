Whether performing at a festival with 30-voice gospel choir South of the River, administering and overdosey-doh to a crowded inner-city pub; or luring party goers of all ages onto the dance floor, The Prayerbabies inevitably win over their audiences with their sly humour and previously inconceivable arrangements of oddly familiar songs. //.entry-content end content The Prayerbabies <h2 class='site-description'>The home of Country n Preston</h2> The home of Country n Preston ‘lectrik mails MailChimp for WordPress v3.1.10 - https://wordpress.org/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/ First Name: Last Name: Email address: / MailChimp for WordPress Plugin Powered by WordPress | Theme: Happenings end wrapper [if lte IE 9]> <script type='text/javascript' src='http://prayerbabies.com/wp-content/plugins/mailchimp-for-wp/assets/js/third-party/placeholders.min.js?ver=3.1.10'></script> <![endif]
