Welcome to the website of Michael “Chikuzen” Gould , master Shakuhachi performer and teacher. My studio offers a variety of services: I teach shakuhachi in a variety of forms ( webcam , camps , home studio , and B&B intensives. ) Students also have the opportunity to obtain a teaching license . (See some of my student testimonials and profiles .) I perform in concerts and give lecture demonstrations at various levels. (See some of my reviews .) I have recorded several CDs and written/co-authored several scorebooks . My most recent CD is Monshogodo with Sebastien Gishin Cyr. I have a blog where I post some of my insights .
