Our organization was created to provide a network of cooporation and inclusion for musicians. We welcome you to join us — membership is free! The Just Plain Folks Music Awards We are excited about current work and preparations for this year's JPF Music Awards. This has always delivered a great opportunity to showcase some truly dynamic talent. If you have not participated in the past, please consider doing so this year. Check out previous winners along with more details below. The Just Plain Folks Music Awards were started in 1999 as a simple way to recognize the best music submitted by members. JPF Founder Brian Austin Whitney felt the music made by the "other 98%" of the music world often ignored by the mainstream televised music awards shows deserved its own recognition. The judging criteria is based around one basic concept: Does the music move you? This one encompassing criteria has since been adopted across much of the mainstream music industry to measure the very best quality of the best music being made today. Once again, we've completed this years quest to find the music that moves us most and recognize it with admiration, fairness and dignity (and a cool JPF Awards trophy). Visit our Awards page for more information on entering, or read the Awards FAQ . The Just Plain Forums We have one of the busiest message boards in the music industry — the Just Plain Forums — and there is something to be found for everyone! You can ask questions for our professional Mentor Staff, post your lyrics and MP3s for critiques and feedback, share your thoughts and opinions on a myriad of music related topics and even learn more about music theory and instrument technique. There are also Chapter Message Boards for some active cities and regions so you can see what is going on in your area, or help start a chapter yourself. You must register separately to post on the message boards, but it is very easy to do. JPF On Tour Each year thousands of members join together for our road trip showcases. In the last 9 years we've visited most of the US and Canada during one of our Just Plain Folks Roadtrips . We've hosted hundreds of Showcases featuring thousands of artist performances. We also host workshops, chapter meetings, networking events and gatherings of all types and even take a little time for tourism when we can. We hope to expand our Roadtrips to include Europe and Australia as our membership grows in those areas. If you'd like to get involved, follow the listings of the Roadtrips in our newsletter and sign up for events anywhere you are interested in participating.
