It wants to be stimulated from a visual and theatrical point of view." Marc Scorca President/CEO OperaAmerica   That is what we here at COPA strive to do.   We are one of the pioneers in presenting an "audience-friendly" hybrid of semi-staged and lightly-costumed opera productions. Venues seating 350-600+ in regional locales provide "up close and personal" experiences appealing to novices and aficionados, alike. Professional and Emerging Artists are featured in standard repertoire, scored for Chamber Orchestra and conducted by Artistic Director, Maestro Yoonhak Baek.   Scheduled Performances Learn More Click to add text...   P.O.
