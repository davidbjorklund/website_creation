All my professional accordion reeds have the makers name stamped on them  I have made the  accordion players aware of the different quality reeds available to them through advertising the different types  in each accordion we sell.  20 years ago very few players in Ireland  would have heard of the Tipo A Mano reeds for example. Tam Reeds as we now call them. Accordion company’s were dropping their standards in order to shift accordions and the only way to cut costs is to use cheaper reeds where possible. Some shops back then were specifying [when ordering accordions] the cheaper reeds in order to offer a better price. in 2008 I asked the reed makers to supply a sticker to back up my guarantee to my customers. Because of my influence on the reed makers, today, In every accordion we sell, there is a sticker from the reed maker stating the type of reeds  in the accordion. Special Offer!
