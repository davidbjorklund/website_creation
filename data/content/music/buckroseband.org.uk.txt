It now performs under the baton of his daughter Becca Heywood, an accomplished musician in her own right. She is not only a fine brass player, but also a notable singer and stage performer. We are a  full-sized concert band based in Wetwang, East Yorkshire.  For those curious, Buckrose was a wapentake of the historic East Riding of Yorkshire. These were administrative districts established in medieval times. The wapentake of Buckrose covered Wetwang and many of the surrounding parishes. The band  comprises of woodwind (clarinet, saxophone,  etc. ), brass (trumpet, trombone,  etc. ) and percussion (drums, glockenspiel etc. ) players. We are self-supporting and all of its players give their time and services for free. We have a membership of over fifty musicians. The Objectives of the band are: To develop and enrich the musical education and skills of the members and the community; To perform works of high musical quality and present a repertoire with wide appeal; To support and satisfy a variety of community sponsored events, and develop a performance band that is an asset to the local community. The repertoire of the band is far reaching and includes a wide variety of light classics, stage and film scores and medleys of popular tunes. Many pieces are chosen to highlight the different sections of the band. We present a number of goodwill performances each year. A recording of a selection of our pieces is available on our limited edition CD ‘Wind On The Wolds’.  We are available for all types of concert work, including concert hall bookings, garden parties, carol concerts, bandstand appearances and private functions. Our reputation is well established in the East Riding where we regularly perform to enthusiastic audiences. In 2014 the band undertook concerts in Belgium. Enquiries regarding booking the concert band can be made from our contact page. We are members of Making Music , Supporting & Championing Voluntary Music and became a registered charity in 2017.
