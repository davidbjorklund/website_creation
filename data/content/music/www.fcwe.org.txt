Their dedication to the ensemble is only surpassed by their love of making music. It was an honor and a privilege to conduct them in a concert of my music!” âJack Stamp, Feb 2019 “It was my pleasure to work with the First Coast Wind Symphony, a superb community of musicians and a first-rate organization.” âFrank Ticheli, Feb. 2018 “If one had the opportunity to attend a round-table discussion with composers Sam Hazo, Robert W. Smith, James Curnow, Robert Sheldon, Richard Saucedo, David Holsinger, and Mark Camphouse, it would most likely prove to be a very spirited exchange of seven decidedly different points of view regarding virtually all aspects of the creative process. But there would, most assuredly, be unanimous agreement on this important point: recognizing and saluting the significant musical achievements and educationally enriching activities of the First Coast Wind Symphony ... a first-rate ensemble that is clearly emerging as a key player in the American community band movement. And to Artie Clifton: bravo sir, on your artistic vision, superb musicianship, and dedication to enhancing the cultural vibrancy of the greater Jacksonville community.” -Mark Camphouse, Feb. 2017 “Guest conducting the First Coast Wind Symphony was such a genuine pleasure. This group of fine musicians are as warm and friendly as they are musically talented. I truly hope I have another chance to share the stage with them!” âSamuel Hazo, Feb. 2016 “My sincere thanks to Artie Clifton and the First Coast Wind Symphony for inviting me to share a concert with them in a performance of my music. As a composer, it is always gratifying to be asked to conduct my own works with a Wind Symphony, but to hear such an outstanding group of musicians performing at such a high level of musical integrity was a special treat. What a fantastic wind symphony! Their professionalism, artistry and energy certainly make this one of the premiere community bands in the country, and certainly one of the musical crown jewels of Florida. Best wishes for continued success!” âRobert Sheldon, Feb 2013 More from other composers… /END THE composer comment /.container FOOTER <div id="concertothang"> <p><img src="images/flute_girl2.jpg" class="kid"></p> <h2>Apply for the 2017 <br>Concerto Competition</h2> <p class="btn_type"><a href="concerto.html" class="btn btn-primary btn-sm">Find out more</a></p> </div> Support Us Contact Us Concerto Comp Rehearsal Schedule Board Members © 2015 First Coast Wind Symphony Bootstrap core JavaScript ================================================== Placed at the end of the document so the pages load faster Just to make our placeholder images work.
