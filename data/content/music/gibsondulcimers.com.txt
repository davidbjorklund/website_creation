While I have incorporated modern improvements, such as geared tuners, nickel silver frets, and âfancierâ sound holes, - the heart, soul and tradition of the mountain dulcimer remains intact." Every Gibson Dulcimer Features: Handcrafted from top quality 100% solid tonewoods with no veneer, plywood or plastic parts. Full two octave fretboard with 16 nickel silver frets including a 6Â½ and 13Â½ fret. Grover Sta-Tite tuning gears with a 14:1 gear ratio and lifetime manufacturer's warranty. A 26" scale lenght with Mother of Pearl or Abalone inlaid position markers at 3rd, 5th, 7th and 10th frets. Nut and bridge configured for both doubled melody string and equidistant spacing. Durable satin lacquer finish. Each dulcimer signed and numbered.                             #EndEditable © 2016 Ron Gibson All Rights Reserved
