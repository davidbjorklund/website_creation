Free Lessons/Interview with Carol Kaye: www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9idtdWAAEA Legendary Studio Hit Drummer RIP Earl Palmer, my great friend of 50 years<br> His Family Website: <a href="http://www.earlpalmermemorial.com" target="_blank">www.earlpalmermemorial.com</a> <br> <br><br>                                                           Note:       Frank Wilson 1965 Motown "Do I Love You" MP3 (with Carol Kaye bass, Earl Palmer drums, cut in Hollywood) This recording auctioned at record $41, 700, is UK soul hit. Frank Wilson recent phone interview. Carol was 1 of 9 bass players recording in Hollywood for Motown 1963 through 1968-69, as verified by Motown producers Frank Wilson, Hal Davis, and also by Pres. of Jobete, Lester Sill, others. MESSAGE: "I'm always deeply devoted since the 1970s to the cause of studio musicians being recognized for the talent and full scope of their depth in helping to create the 1960s-70s hit records and movie/TV show soundtracks. The Denny Tedesco-Hal Blaine "wrecking" film-doc doesn't tell the real story as he said it would, it's skewered, re-edited. We were never known as the Hal Blaine-invented 1990 self-promo "wrecking crew" term - like Leon Russell, Al Kooper others say, that's pure baloney. The 50-60 of us (out of 400+ hard-working recording musicians) were sometimes called the CLIQUE and most were successful jazz musicians with fine reputations before ever doing studio work. Kent Hartman obtained my interview under fraud pretenses. His phony "wrecking" book re-invents history, please don't buy it. See my Autobiography! Thank you, Carol K. I support the Howard Roberts Tribute Documentary which has many of our Studio Musicians in it. Earl Palmer was the #1 most--recorded hit-drummer 1947-2006. We were never clowns, nor the nuttiness shown on that film, but top professional people. Movie-TV-film studio musicians were the finest in the world and never said what Blaine (Belsky) said, instead they complimented us - I worked film calls with them every day while Blaine was never a movie musician. I deplore the pretender-writer who defrauded me in order to get "magazine" quotes for his slanderous-misogynist flawed "wrecking" book to make his $$$$, shame on him for lying and misquoting me - ditto the Tedesco-Blaine silly and wrong film. I am not the only one upset about this wrong depiction. This "use" is not legitimate." Carol K.<br> On Any Sunday filmscore cues, 1971.
