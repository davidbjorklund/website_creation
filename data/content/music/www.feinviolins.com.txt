I served my apprenticeship at the Chicago School of Violin Making, studied instrument and bow identification with Kenneth Warren, Sr., and completed a B.A. (Cum Laude) in Music from Wesleyan University in Connecticut. I continue to study instruments, particularly the instruments of Antonius Stradivarius and his predecessors, at the National Music Museum, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Smithsonian Museum, the Ashmolean Museum, with master violin maker Amnon Weinstein in Tel Aviv, and with esteemed colleagues and conservators from around the world. Despite all the activity on our website, we are still a small business with a personal approach to every instrument and every customer. Before an instrument is ready to leave our shop, it is set up and finished by me, played by one of the professional musicians on staff, and checked and adjusted for tone quality. Then we ship your instrument directly to you, set up and ready to play as soon as you open the case!  While we are dedicated to bringing you the best possible instrument to suit your needs, we are also dedicated to the environment. Our shop is powered by wind through Excel Energy's Windsource program . We also make a point to recycle, to use LED light bulbs, and to conserve energy and resources whenever possible. We're the only violin shop in the Twin Cities area, and one of very few violin shops nationwide, that's a member of the Better Business Bureau. When you read our instrument reviews, you will discover that our clients are not just customers. We're interested in supporting your musical endeavors by providing quality instruments at reasonable prices. I'm proud of my shop and the excellent customer service provided by my staff of string players. We take great pride in what we do. Andy Fein  Policies and Shipping You have 10 full days after you receive your instrument to play it, evaluate it, and fall in love with it.
