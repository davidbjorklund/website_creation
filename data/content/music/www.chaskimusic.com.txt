Chaski is now on Instagram! Follow us @chaski85 ! Chaski launches its new program Words & Other Wild Things ! Bramble - Kingfisher - Adder - Newt - Raven. These words conjure pictures of wild things and untamed spaces but get shortchanged in modern urban life. The words themselves fade from our vocabularies when the natural world is less present in our daily lives. In music and poetry, Chaski retrieves these words and images in Words & Other Wild Things . This program draws from Chaskiâs rich repertoire of classical, Celtic, Latin American Folk, and other genres to celebrate the words that connect us to nature. Words & Other Wild Things is inspired by the Robert Macfarlane/Jackie Morris illustrated book of poetry, The Lost Words . Chaski shares donations from this concert with Central Texas Library System . to host a concert!

Follow Chaski on Spotify! Flutes, harps & the whole world to play in! Chaski is what you get when you take a virtuosic flute/harp duo, add a colorful collection of flutes and harps from around the world, and explore music to include them all. For over 30 years Chaski has toured with repertoire ranging from the Mozart Flute/Harp Concerto, to Bolivian huayÃ±os, Scottish strathspeys, tunes from Playford's "The English Dancing Master" (published 1651), and world premieres of new works. Chaski frequently works in collaboration with solo artists, choirs, and, most recently, with a modern dance company, accompanying the dancers and performing alongside them. © 1997-2019 Chaski | Design by FCT | Images by Fotogrph
