We are looking into venues for future presentations...  Posted by René Mogensen at 10:19 AM No comments: Thursday, December 10, 2009 Views from Plato's Cave We had a great premiere of my composition Views from Plato's Cave , for trombone and computer, performed by Niels-Ole Bo Johansen! The audience was appreciative and one compliment I got was that it reminded of Takamitsu. In composing the work I had drawn a lot of inspiration from, and made references to Berio, Debussy, and Xenakis. :) It was in a concert in Kammermusiksalen at Musikhuset Aarhus, on Saturday December 5, 2009. I forgot to take photos at the concert, so I'll just post a little snapshot from the score.
