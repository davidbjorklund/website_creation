My feet are killing me this morning - so much dancing!!! Jane X Jane, London We had a great time - and so did the band! Really good sound looking forward to seeing you again at the next gig if not before. Chris & Jacquie Having recovered somewhat, would you be so kind as to thank the band for helping make our party a great one. The sets were spot on, and we have heard nothing but praise from our gathering, most commonly used term was ‘awesome’ I believe. You guys have made another set of admirers whom I’m sure will be at future gigs. Bosko, London We'd be grateful if you could pass on our thanks to all the band for their performance on Saturday and contributing to out celebration. All night people kept telling us how good the band were. We've put a link to your web page on our Facebook page. I know you all travelled quite a distance to find us, but you all seemed to be enjoying yourselves, too, which fitted the tone of the evening. Pat, Southend @ftcsoulband @peltonarms The fun you have playing those songs totally comes across, a joy for all. Don't make us wait too long for next gig!
