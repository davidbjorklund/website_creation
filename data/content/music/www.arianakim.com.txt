A recipient of a Cornell Affinito-Stewart Grant and a Society for the Humanities Grant, Ariana released her first solo album Routes of Evanescence  in December of 2015 which features works for solo violin and violin + 1 written by American women composers including Ruth Crawford Seeger, Augusta Read Thomas, and Jennifer Curtis.  While on sabbatic leave from Cornell in 2016, Ariana lived and worked in Italy, teaching at l'Istituto Stradivari, performing with Milano Classica, and curating a cultural diplomacy public art project involving the Cornell Composition Department, the Cornell Architecture Department, and a group of North African and Mid-East refugees.  She performed two solo recital tours in Northern and Central Italy featuring works from J.S. Bach to Elliott Carter to bluegrass fiddle tunes; she is set to return to her “home away from home” this coming summer for a performance at the Paesaggi Musicali Toscani in Siena. An avid chamber musician of both the contemporary and traditional literature, Ariana is a newly-appointed violinist of the Aizuri Quartet, with whom she won the gold medal and grand prize at the 2017 Osaka Triennial Competition in Japan.  Since beginning with the ensemble in mid-2016, they have made their Kennedy Center debut, recorded their first album of new works commissioned by and written for the group, and are currently the String Quartet-In-Residence at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City.  Hailed by the Washington Post , [their] “performance drew from that meld of intellect, technique and emotions,” their forthcoming album is due for release on New Amsterdam Records in the Fall of 2018. Ariana now marks her 12th season with The Knights, a New York-based imaginative and diverse musical collective that performs programs ranging from string quartets to bluegrass tunes and Mid-East folk music, to the great chamber orchestra masterpieces of the 20th century.  The ensemble recently toured France, Germany, and Austria and are in the midst of a multi-season residency at BRIC in Brooklyn.  Knights collaborative projects have included work with Yo-Yo Ma, Bela Fleck, Dawn Upshaw, Susan Graham, Gil Shaham, among others.  In January of 2015, the group released its seventh album,  …the ground beneath our feet  – a collection of live performances from a recent U.S. tour – for Warner Classics, on which Ariana is a featured soloist in Steve Reich’s  Duo  for two violins and strings, alongside Guillaume Pirard; that track has since received much acclaim and was chosen as one of NPR's "Songs We Love” for 2015. Ariana also served 10 seasons as a member of the  New Yorker -acclaimed New York new music ensemble, Ne(x)tworks, which made their international debut at the John Cage Festival in Berlin performing Cage’s “Song Books” to a packed house alongside the Maulwerker Company in March 2013.  Their dedication to the interpretation of graphic scores, open notation and collective improvisation led to a rare recording of the chamber music of Earle Brown, available on MODE Records. Raised in Minnesota by parents Ellen and Young-Nam whom were her teachers from age 3 to 17, Ariana finds another musical home in her native Twin Cities as she is now in her 14th season with the Chamber Music Society of Minnesota.  Recent collaborations have included performances with Robert Mann, Fred Sherry, Peter Wiley, Samuel Rhodes, Nobuko Imai, Charles Neidich, and Leon Fleisher.  The proud educational wing of the Society, CMSMnext brings her to Twin Cities schools, conservatories, and community programs to offer presentations, outreach workshops and master classes. Ariana has spent summers at Ravinia's Steans Institute, Yellow Barn, and Orford Centre d'Arts.  A passionate pedagogue, Ariana spends much of the academic year teaching and mentoring a full studio of talented collegiate students at Cornell; this summer, she will join the faculty of the Palo Alto Chamber Music Workshop for the 17th consecutive year, the Northern Lights Chamber Music Institute for the 11th time, and the Crowden Music Center Chamber Music Institute for the fourth time.  She volunteers annually with the Title One school, Castillero Middle in San Jose, CA and has presented master classes throughout the U.S. and abroad at such institutions as Kent State University, The MacPhail Center, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Ariana received her masters and doctorate from the Juilliard School under the tutelage of the late Robert Mann, her undergraduate degree from the San Francisco Conservatory with Ian Swensen and Camilla Wicks, and currently co-resides in Ithaca and New York City.    .scrollcontent #section1 [if lte IE 7]><a name="schedule"></a><![endif] Schedule home biography schedule gallery pr materials watch & listen contact links blog #schedulepage Upcoming Events - Spring 2019 June 18, 2019 @ 8pm The Knights @ Central Park Temple Emanu-El Mendelssohn Octet + works by Britten & Lisa Bielawa 1 E. 65th Street New York, NY PAST EVENTS - 2015-2018 May 20-June 1, 2015 The Knights Benefit & European Concert Tour with guest Dawn Upshaw Works by Haydn, Zhou Long, Shostakovich and more • May 21 @ 6:30pm Benefit Fundraiser Tribeca Rooftop 2 Desbrosses Street New York, NY 10013 • May 25 @ 6pm Staatstheater Darmstadt Georg-Buchner Platz 1 64283 Darmstadt, GERMANY • May 26 @ 8pm Festspielhaus Baden Baden Beim Alten Banhof 2 76530 Baden-Baden, GERMANY • May 27-29 @ 7:30pm Grosses Festspielhause Salzburg Hoftstallgasse 1 5020 Slazburg, AUSTRIA • May 30 @ 7:30pm Musikverein Musikvereinplatz 1 1010 Wien (Vienna), AUSTRIA June 5, 2015 @ 8pm Brooklyn Rider Guest Appearance with Ian Rosembaum, marimba Works by Andy Akiho and Paula Matthusen The American Academy in Rome Rome, ITALY June 7, 2015 @ 4pm Chamber Music Society of Minnesota - Subscription Series with Paul Schoenfield, guest composer/pianist Works by Schoenfield and others (CD Release Concert!)
