(at Rockwood Music Hall 3) https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz8gPYvFqzU/?igshid=10h7ym7z6wmts Photo Post I’ve had this cartoon clipping in my wallet since I was a 15 or 16. Taped over to keep it safe. Whenever I see it I marvel that by some miracle (plus love, support, and privilege) I’m actually able to do what I do. This is one of those weeks: a new album out, a show with musicians I admire – a dizzying variety of shows in one week, from cowboy songs in the capital, to the ever-renewing nyc music scene. Thank. You. All. (at Clinton Hill, Brooklyn) https://www.instagram.com/p/Bz6H3n7lOpQ/?igshid=16k9aw9a5nei6 Photo Post “Visions and Revisions" is out today! Listen everywhere > https://fanlink.to/andrewvladeck “Visions and Revisions” (title thanks to T.S. Eliot) is classic singer-songwriter roll-down-the-windows soul-searcher rock — with quirks. To my own surprise it seems there’s a fair amount of singing in an almost spoken word/hip-hop vein. There’s a harkening back Lou Reed, Beck, Jonathan Richman, Dylan and The Boss. Lyrically I’m going for a sorta midwestern intellectual dreamfire with just the right amount of New York attitude. V+R introduces new songs alongside favorite revisitations of my songbook recorded over a good while. I’m incredibly fortunate that so many talented musicians contributed to this effort. Special thanks to Mastering Engineer Jamal Ruhe who sonically shaped all of it into a solid and cohesive album. I’m thrilled that these songs might be in your ears as you go about your summer. I hope you find it satisfying. xoAV Visions and Revisions // Album Credits Cover Photo & Design by Bernie DeChant You’ll Get Yours Produced by Sam Kassirer at Great North Sound Society Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Vocals Sean Trischka – Drums, Bass, Electric Guitar, Background Vocals Sam Kassierer – Keyboards Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music The Songs You Inspire Produced by Roger Greenawalt Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Banjo, Vocals Roi Starr – Drums Bill Malchow – Keys Roger Greenawalt – Bass, Steel Guitar Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Hold Me Back Produced by Roger Greenawalt Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Banjo, Vocals Roi Starr – Drums Roger Greenawalt – Bass, Steel Guitar Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Alibi Produced by Sam Kassirer at Great Northern Sound Society Sean Trischka – Drums, Bass, Electric Guitar, Background Vocals Sam Kassierer – Keyboards Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Harmonica, Vocals Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Stronger Produced by Roger Greenawalt Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Vocals Brad Gunyon – Drums Rozz Nash – Background Vocals Roger Greenawalt – Bass, Steel Guitar Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Sleeping on my Own Couch Produced by Jesse McGrath Andrew Vladeck - Guitar, Vocals Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Waiting for the Coffee to Kick in Produced by Felix McTeigue Bill Malchow – Keys Felix McTeigue – Drums, Vocals, Bass Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Vocals Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music The Magnet Produced by Felix McTeigue Bill Malchow – Keys Felix McTeigue – Drums, Vocals, Bass Andrew Vladeck ¬– Guitar, Vocals Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Chasing the Sun Produced by Malcolm Burn Jason Lawrence – Drums Malcolm Burn – Electric Guitar, Piano Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Vocals Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music These Streets Produced by Roger Greenawalt Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Harmonica, Vocals Bill Malchow – Keys Brad Gunyon – Drums Roger Greenawalt – Bass, Steel Guitar Words and Music by Andrew Vladeck Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Angle of the Sun Words and Music by Tom Ward (Galacia Music), additional lyrics Andrew Vladeck Produced by Kaia Fischer and Pascal Balthrop Mixed by Kaia Fischer Recorded by Pascal Balthrop Jason Lawrence – Drums Chris Buckridge – Bass Andrew Vladeck – Guitar, Vocals Pascal Balthrop – percussion Quinn McCarthy – recorded drums The Creamery Studio Mastered by Jamal Ruhe at West West Side Music Photo Post Next week I release my new album “visions and revisions.” In anticipation I’m sharing a photo by the photographer who shot the album cover: @thirddegreebernie Go check out his amazing work.
