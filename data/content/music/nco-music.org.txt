We are the Nashua Chamber Orchestra The Nashua Chamber Orchestra seeks to fill an important niche between the full symphony and the chamber ensemble, focusing on works written for small orchestra. A charter member of the Nashua Arts and Humanities Coalition, the NCO seeks to provide a supportive environment for talented amateurs to perform classical music of high caliber before an appreciative audience. Under our Music Director David Feltner, we continue to grow musically and to move in exciting new directions.
