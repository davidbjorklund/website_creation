My promise My promise and intent with this domain was to keep it open for all alumni. I have been busy for the last six years with getting through college. During that time the site has run into some maintenance issues that I will be fixing as I become aware of them. My apologies for any problems in the past couple of years and send me a message to the webmaster if you read this. I am interested in what has happened in the past five years.
