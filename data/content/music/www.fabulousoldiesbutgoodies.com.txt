 Fabulous Oldies But Goodies For over 25 years the band has played festivals, classic car shows, and concerts throughout Michigan, Indiana, and Ohio. The Fabulous Oldies But Goodies Band is an authentic blast to the past when rock and roll was young: harmonizing vocals, in front of "Jerry Lee" style piano, classic sax riffs, and driving rhythms. The band has performed with Chuck Berry, The Platters, Bill Haley's Comets, the Marcels, members of Motown, Rare Earth, the Reflections, the Royaltones, Johnny and the Hurricanes, the Del Shannon Band, and Danny and the Juniors. Rock and Roll is here to stay! ABOUT US PHOTO ALBUM SONG LIST CONTACT US SCHEDULE gshall@fabulousoldiesbutgoodies.com Â  Please note our email address change below!!
