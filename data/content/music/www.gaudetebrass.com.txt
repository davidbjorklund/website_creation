Gaudete Brass Welcome About Bios Schedule Recordings Multimedia Acclaim Online Store Press Kit Contact The Gaudete Brass Quintet The Gaudete Brass is made up of five musicians who believe in the expressive power of brass chamber music. Since 2004 the quintet has creatively expanded the quintet repertoire, developing unique programs that have resonated with audiences across America. Gaudete has performed live and on radio in New York and Chicago, commissioned new works from noted composers such as David Sampson and Stacy Garrop, and has recorded four albums, including two for Cedille Records. Gaudete has also presented educational programs at many schools including Juilliard and Eastman. Gaudete (gow-day-tay) is a form of the Latin word for “Joy.” We support the idea that chamber music, even (and perhaps especially) the serious kind, can powerfully communicate both the poignant and the exuberant.
