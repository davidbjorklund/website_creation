Hi! - Thanks for stopping by my web-site. If your'e a classical music lover or a curious music listener - hopefully this site will keep you better informed of what I'm up to.

Thanks to all for the positive feedback and reviews I had for my Brahms Sonatas CD on the Tall Poppies label. Tall Poppies have just released my new CD -"Cafe Fiddle"

It is a collection "dessert" or "encore" pieces - many sadly not heard much any more. These are the pieces that many audiences waited for at the end of recital programs from the golden era. My pianist is the late great Milton Kaye.
