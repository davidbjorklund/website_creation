Anne MacCallum "Grace so underserved, yet freely given..." SONGWRITING CONFERENCES MISSIONS WORSHIP LEADER & TEACHER Anne MacCallum God has taken Anne through strong lessons about freedom, forgiveness, and life-altering grace.      Her music and woship reflects these experiences of discovery. There is a clear appreciation in her lyrics for the wonders of a âGod of sacrifice,â and a joy in being freely His. Â Â Â Â  The ministry Anne desires is to lead people into a fresh worship experience. In addition to her lessons in song, Anne shares through teaching and exhortation the love of Christ that has changed her life. For her, worship is a whole-life encounter and a privilege no child of God should miss. ANNE@ANNE SINGS .com Conferences Missions Songwriter Contact
