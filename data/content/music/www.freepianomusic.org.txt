Since the invention of the piano in the 18th century… Composers and audiences alike have been profoundly moved and inspired from the perfect structure of Mozart’s piano sonatas, to Vladimir Horowitz’s fiery piano transcriptions, to Thesolonius Monk’s bebop and jazz arrangements and in the pop piano world with Billy Joel’s famous tune – the “piano man”.

The advantages of using the internet are as follows: ability to find rare piano sheet music, mp3s and videos found nowhere else easily connect with and learn about other pianists’ experiences instant access to printable piano sheet music and other downloadable music files enjoy memorable performances without having to leave the house The disadvantages of using the internet are as follows, including possible solutions. “Am I getting the real thing?” The audio/video quality of music downloads are inferior to those of an acoustic live performance. (although the quality of YouTube videos are improving and ISPs are working on ways to increase bandwidth while reducing the costs) “Help … I don’t know what’s good anymore?!” It is difficult and time-consuming to sift through the sheer amount of music out there. (more quality sites which can take online audiences by the hand will help bring the quality back in piano music)   The future of piano music The 21st century has created a wide gap between the austere, aristocratic pianist who commands absolute silence from the audience and the pretentious rock-star who commands anything but silence. Naturally, all of our beliefs stem from our own real-life experiences as being concert pianists. Keeping this in mind, we have learned to respect other people’s tastes even if they don’t always correspond with ours, and through simply offering our own opinion and viewpoints we hope to inspire anyone taking piano classes or intense instruction to learn from the traditional past yet still look ahead into the glorious future. We believe modern, young pianists should unite and work towards a common cause (and now for some academic lingo) … … to continue progressively developing their creative outlets; … to present new ideas that maintain a sensitive balance between the objective and subjective aspects of a piece of music; … to nurture and cultivate an understanding of musical styles yet still allow room for flexibility and innovation; … to uncover unique ways of connecting with a modern audience while utilizing the full potential of technology as well as their very own personal charisma, wit and charm.   Blog Categories Artist/Band/Performer Category The latest blog entries featuring detailed posts about your favorite artists, bands, and performers.
