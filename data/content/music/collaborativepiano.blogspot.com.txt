Emily's video: Another point that Emily makes after 5:39 is that it's the younger people in the profession who will bring genuine change to the field that will make it a more supportive environment. Let's enable them to succeed. The worst advice anyone gave me? Here are two examples: Well-known composer: You pay too much attention to quality of tone at the piano to ever have a career in contemporary music. Senior administrator: You don't strike me as the kind of person who would be interested in graduate school. Of course we get shitty advice along the way. The important thing is to be able to recognize it and move on. But when you've spent lots of time in the profession and know the lay of the land, offer advice that people will admire you for one day.

A parent is looking for a new piano teacher and all they have to go by is a phone number so they'll enter it on a list on their phone and then call once they have time to call because no one has time for phone calls any more . Then when their prospective piano teacher gets the call, they're busy so they'll have to check messages later, write the message down and get back to the prospective parent once they have phone time but prospective parent isn't answering calls so they'll have to leave a message and the next round of phone tag begins. Two days later they connect. Let's try that again with online registration. The parent goes to the teacher's website, clicks on the "Register for Lessons" button, enters relevant info on their child and the piano teacher gets back within a few hours and the initial consultation is set up for the next day. Done. This is why your website needs that very basic feature - it will quite literally put you ahead of other teachers in your area in the queue for getting more students. Being more easily findable and contactable will result your studio getting more students, many of them traveling larger distances. Both My Music Staff and Music Teacher's Helper have these features on all their packages, and are worth the investment. Best wishes for the new academic year! Posted by Chris Foley at 6:37 AM 0 comments Labels: Marketing Wednesday, September 05, 2018 Sparks & Wiry Cries Launch Their 7th Season Sparks & Wiry Cries is an organization that promotes the advancement and preservation of art song. Led by Martha Guth and Erika Switzer, they are entering their seventh season and this year's events feature songSLAM events in Ann Arbor, Minneapolis, Toronto, New York, Slovenia, Chicago, and Denver. Martha Guth encapsulates their mission perfectly with this quote: Sparks & Wiry Cries was born out of a passionate desire to keep the genre flourishing, to provide opportunities for those in its community and to support the growth of new art song, because the stories we tell, and the connections we make are critical to our humanity.  What is songSLAM? Each event is: a unique competition for emerging composer/performer teams to premiere new art song, in partnership with Source Song Festival. In the poetry-slam tradition, audience members vote on their favorite performances, and $900 in cash prizes are awarded. Sparks & Wiry Cries also publish an art song magazine and podcast . If you feel moved to support their activities, you can also donate . Best of luck to Martha and Erika as they embark on Season 7. Here's a video of Martha talking about Sparks & Wiry Cries' many activities: Posted by Chris Foley at 6:52 AM 0 comments Labels: art song Tuesday, September 04, 2018 4 Choices for Building Studio Websites In my last article I looked at  why you need a website for your teaching studio . Building a website can be daunting, and in today's article I've chosen four services that make the process relatively simple to learn once you take the initiative to start. The picture above is a slide from a talk I gave at The Royal Conservatory this summer, and it outlines four top choices you may wish to consider when building teaching websites. The prices below are accurate to early September 2018 and don't reflect future increases, decreases, or promotions. But in reality the price doesn't matter. Once you've got a viable online presence and attract even one student for half-hour lessons for only one semester, each one of these services would have more than paid for a yearly investment. 1. My Music Staff I use My Music Staff for my teaching website , and I run my studio using its tools. In addition to the website features, you can create a database of students, schedule them on a calendar, and tie those lessons to invoicing features, all visible on student and parent dashboards. You can also accept credit card payments, keep a repertoire database, manage downloads, expenses, mileage, publish a blog, and generate studio reports. My Music Staff is web-based, so you're engaging with the site in a browser. However, it's a very fast and responsive site, and renders perfectly on any kind of device you're using. The MMS team have a strong Agile software development philosophy, so they iterate the service weekly with new features (their latest new feature as of late August was video streaming , among others). The price is another huge selling point: $12.95 for unlimited students and storage both in the US and Canada. 2. Music Teacher's Helper I discovered Music Teacher's Helper in 2007 at the Toronto MTNA conference, and this company was the pioneer in the field of integrated studio websites. MTH has most of the same features as MMS although they are app-based, so the development schedule is not as speedy as that of MMS. Where MTH excel is in the large community of teachers writing for their blog  and their extensive setup guides that you can buy in order to get your studio set up to compete online. Pricing depends on the size of your studio - when paid annually, the three tiers are US$11.66/month (up to 20 students), US$24.16/month (40 students), and US$40.83/month (unlimited students). Both MMS and MTH can provide websites, although of the somewhat rudimentary kind. If you want a website that looks genuinely fabulous and has a much wider array of content and features, you might wish to consider the next two options. Be aware that you can use both MMS and MTH on the back-end of the next two options - with a small widget, students can easily log in from your third-party studio site to see their student dashboard. 3. Squarespace If you don't know anything about building websites but still want something that looks fabulous, Squarespace is one of the best out-of-the-box solutions, with a more sophisticated depth of content that you can offer, including online stores and marketing tools. Take a look at the template selection  - there are some beautiful designs here. Pricing as of writing is US$12/month for a personal site and US$18/month at the business tier. 4. WordPress 31% of the internet runs on WordPress. Although the learning curve might be a bit higher than with other services, you'll have access to themes, plugins, and Google Apps to help you get your site started. If you want to go with WordPress.com, pricing options are free (with ads and limited options), personal ($60/year CDN), premium ($120/year CDN), and business ($396/year CDN). Or you can self-host your website and use WordPress's open-source tools . A small side-note about WordPress - its lead developer is none other than Helen Hou-Sandì , a graduate of Eastman's collaborative piano program. You might remember that a while back Helen redesigned this site - I've kept the same basic design since then.
