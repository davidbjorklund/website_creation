Jennifer and Ben had the good fortune of meeting Manu and Sita, the directors of the guest house at Radhadesh, at a Kirtan in Paris where Ben also played, and upon accepting their invitation to visit, they fell in love with the castle, the energy, the food, and even the cows that are living a peaceful life on the campus. Fresh, delicious vegan and vegetarian food served daily at Radhadesh Retreatants will have plenty of free time to explore the natural wonders on the property. About Emaho! Retreats: Emaho is a Tibetan word that means wonderful, amazing, or miraculous. Founded by Jennifer Schmidt and Ben Beirs in 2018, Emaho! Retreats are grounded in the principle that the ordinariness of everyday life is extraordinary, and that through the practices and foundations offered at their retreats, students can become more in tune with the timeless wisdom and goodness that is waiting to be uncovered and recovered within all of us.
