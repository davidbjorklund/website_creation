TARGET GIGS (Full Details) FRIDAY / JULY 12th (& AUGUST 9th) / TODDY BROOK GOLF COURSE / N YARMOUTH ME / 6PM / 207-829-5100... I play every 2nd FRIDAY, every month. I'm a Yarmouth native... this spot is just over the town line in N Yarmouth, but it feels like home to me. The food's great, the view's inspiring, the people are wicked friendly & my voice floats nicely in this room. You might consider calling in a reservation for dinner... I've seen some pretty packed nights in here! Here's the Toddy Brook website . MONDAY / JULY 15th / FOOTLIGHTS THEATRE / FALMOUTH ME / 7PM / 207-747-5434... although this theatre is in its 7th year of operation, this is a brandy new concert series, spearheaded by owner/director/actor Michael Tobin & singer-songwriter Carole Wise. This summer's concert line up boasts some of Maine's finest musical performers... I am pleased & humbled to have been asked to take part in the beginning of a summer series that, I hope, will continue into many years ahead. All concerts are "pay what you can"... 1st come, 1st served... BUT, if you have 6 or more coming, call ahead & book seats. Doors open about a 1/2 hour prior to show time & there'll be an intermission for chatting, purchasing CD's & sharing refreshments. Please let folks know about this budding concerts series... the theatre is only 5 minutes from downtown Portland & easy to find! MONDAY / JULY 22nd / POLAND SPRING RESORT / SUNSET CONCERT SERIES / POLAND SPRING ME / 6:30PM / 207-998-4142... concerts now are outdoors at the gazebo, with the White Mountains in view as a backdrop... gorgeous! Bring a chair & a picnic if you wish. If weather dictates we move inside, I'll perform in the All Souls Chapel, one of my fave places to sing. Either way, this series is a win/win, produced by & created to support The Preservation Society at Poland Spring. Staff will collect donations at the concert site... please be generous. I love singing here & helping to preserve the history of Poland Spring. Bring the family to enjoy a concert with a grand view & a special mission. Here's the link to the Preservation Society , where donations are always appreciated, concert or no concert. THURSDAY / JULY 25th / GREENVILLE GAZEBO SERIES / GREENVILLE ME / 7PM / 207-695-2702... I have always loved playing here beside Moosehead Lake with the sun setting ever so sweetly on the water & over the surrounding mountains. This scene is like a summer postcard enticing enough to make one drive the extra miles to be part of it. If it rains (NOT!) we move inside, venue to be announced. (If you're in town, go to the gazebo & check for signs announcing the rain site.) If it's a nice evening, bring chairs or a blanket, a cooler with some summer snacks & bevies & be ready to sing one, dance to one, or both. Call the Moosehead Lake Region Chamber of Commerce (above) for furthers. SATURDAY / JULY 27th / MAYNARD'S CAMPS / ROCKWOOD ME / 3:30PM / 207-534-7703... this will be a pre-dinner 100th Anniversary Concert! (Dinner starts at 5:00... call ahead for reservations & YES! I am staying for dinner, so hang out with us! BYOB, just FYI.) We are hoping I can set up on the porch at the lodge, so if the weather looks good, bring a chair & your fave beverage. (We'll move inside if necessary.) Gail Maynard has a BIG HEART & she would like you to know we'll be collecting donations during the concert to support "Hope for the Homeless" in Bangor... otherwise, the concert is a free celebration show... 100 years? Holy Guacamole! That's a helluva long time for one family to be running those camps! Please spread the word on this one... hope to see you there. MONDAY / AUGUST 5th / GOOD ENERGY CAFE / JORDAN HALL / OCEAN PARK ME (Old Orchard Beach) / 4:30 to 6PM... this is a summer music series called "Arts & Appetizers By the Sea"... & the line up for said series is quite impressive. The venue is as well. So pleased to be called on to join the roster of talent that will be performing here. Door fee is nominal folks: a $5 donation gets you in the door to hear the music & to enjoy a happy hour of sorts with apps, beverages & lots of friendly faces. REALLY looking forward to this one! THURSDAY / AUGUST 8th / LENNY'S / WESTBROOK ME / 7PM / 207-591-0117... Lenny's is on Rt. 302 at the old Al Hawkes Plaza... you know, with the guy out front swinging a tool box? Bill Umbel created this eclectic, down-to-earth venue, named it in honor of the late, great Lenny Breau & he's booking some of the best acoustic players around.... so happy to be part of the family, playing once a month (usually, but not in July.) The vibe here feels like a small "Raoul's Roadside Attraction"... remember THAT place? Grab some pals & head over... bring your appetite for food & music both. FRIDAY / AUGUST 9th / TODDY BROOK GOLF COURSE / N YARMOUTH ME / 6PM / 207-829-5100... see JULY 12th for details. TUESDAY / AUGUST 13th / DRUMMORE BAY CONCERT HALL / PHIPPSBURG ME / 7PM / 207-446-7199 / This is a TRULY COOL VENUE! My 7th show here I think... they can't keep me away! My friend & fellow musician Jackson Gay & his wife Jean purchased this building with a vision for all good things happening, mostly musically involved. Jack put in a really great sound system... my voice feels like a million bucks in here. Between my musical sets, decadent pies & other gourmet desserts, coffee & tea will be available to make a sweet night even sweeter. The venue is at 516 Main Rd (Rt 209 out of Bath)... easy to find. RESERVATIONS are strongly encouraged. You can call Jean at 207-446-7199 or order tix from the website here . FRIDAY / AUGUST 23rd / THE BIRCHES RESORT / ROCKWOOD ME / 7PM / 207-534-2242... this is such a lovely setting... Right on the edge of Moosehead Lake... an intimate dining room with a big windows' view of Mount Kineo. Full bar, great food & yours truly hummin' & strummin' from 7 to 9:30PM. Worth the ride folks... call ahead to see if there's space left there for an overnight stay. (Definitely make a dinner reservation if you're planning on eating... tell them you're an Anni Fanni.) If there's no room to stay, there are plenty of choices nearby if you want to make a weekend out of it. There are some super hikes in the area with great views, moose watching, fishing, swimming, kayaking, camping... the list is endless. back to top 3. SNEAK PEEK AHEAD (Not-To-Be-Missed Upcoming Shows) FRIDAY / SEPTEMBER 20th / BIDDEFORD-SACO COUNTRY CLUB / SACO ME / 6:30PM / 207-282-9892... my debut here in May 2017 was fun as all get out, so I keep goin' back, whenever they'll have me! This is a spacious room with views of the grounds, great food & gregarious, life lovin' patrons. Never been? You'll probably run into all kinds of people you know if you come... I play 3 sets, 6:30 to 9:30... come early, have dinner, stay late... you DON'T have to be a member to come, but they'll treat ya like one anyway... MONDAY / OCTOBER 28th / SLATES / HALLOWELL ME / 8PM... OMG... I just looked it up. I haven't performed at Slates since 2012! WHAT? I'll call it the seven year itch... gotta get back. This, of course, is one of those venues well known for its Monday night concert series. In addition to the great vibe & class acts line up, the food here is to die for... October seems a long way off, but write this one down. My goal is to pack 'em in after a 7 year hiatus. Reservations info will be added at the end of summah. back to top 4. CURRENT CEREBRAL WANDERINGS After more than a month, I am STILL recovering from acute sinusitis & bronchitis! My voice goes "in & out" & my left ear (ruptured at the end of May due to sinus pressure) has not fully healed. This is, of course, an ongoing concern & my symptoms create daily challenges when performing shows. I am doing everything I can to alleviate these symptoms & remain hopeful that they will dissipate in the days ahead. I have learned that I am not the only person who has suffered this spring & early summer with these symptoms... many other singers in this area have lost their voices in recent weeks as well! (Here in Maine, the thick pollen & the wind this year have together been brutal for all allergy sufferers.) Meanwhile, if you've been following along, I have been in the studio recording my song "I'm with You, Greta"... (If you missed the Greta story, I'm talking about Greta Thunberg, a 16 year old from Sweden who has been nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize for her work in engaging folks of all ages, in all countries, to voice loudly their concerns about climate change. Google her... if you aren't in the know about Greta, you should be... she's been on the cover of Time Magazine recently & she was listed as one of the top 100 most influential people in the world! Yeah... at 16 years old.) Anyway, I was full on diligent with my arsenal of holistic strategies to heal my voice & my clogged chest the day before I was to record my lead & harmony vocals on this tune on June 19th. I arrived at the studio with one mission... get 'er done in one take. I am soooo pleased & even more relieved to be able to tell you I did just THAT! Well, I had a couple spots to fine tune, but all in all, I did what needed to be done. I thank the powers that be for allowing this to happen. I am poised & ready to begin getting this tune "OUT THERE"... as soon as I have a final mix I will let y'all know... & I hope y'all will help me pass it along & share ideas about how to move it forward. My biggest hope is to get it to Greta herself... I want her to know I'm on her team. Thanks for the healing thoughts you've all been sending... the first half of 2019 has been a real challenge for me in so may ways... I am confident the second half will smooth out & I'll be back to my old self... (in a new, more experienced & appreciative way.) Thanks, as always, for following my ramblings, be they cerebral, musical, literal or otherwise. Hope to see some of you soon... at a gig, on a mountain top, or maybe at the beach.
