In time, the brothers entered into the craft, each having mastered all aspects of mechanical fabrication and aesthetic detail. Flute virtuoso William Bennett and his friends Adrian Brett, Richard and Chris Taylor introduced critical refinements to the Arista instrument that make this flute unsurpassed in craftsmanship and tonal quality. It is an instrument that, in the words of Mr. Bennett, embodies "That mysterious something that only a few old french flutes have."    THE ARISTA TEAM Juan Arista, Master Flute Maker Photo by John Burke Photography   Martha Totten, Flute Maker Phot o by John Burke Photography   Oto Garcia, Body Maker Photo by John Burke Photography THE  ARISTA  WORKSHOP   10 Railroad Avenue  |  Bedford  MA  01730  |   781 275 8821 (p)  |  781 275 5404 (f)  |  info@aristaflutes.com Site produced by Flutistry Boston  |   Copyright Arista Flutes LLC 2013  |  All rights reserved
