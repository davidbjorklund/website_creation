This was a very heartfelt & spontaneous urge from our part after discovering & understanding his virtuosity.., his rich philosophy & spiritualism which blossoms in his music , a simple person who is creating & performing out of the world sound silently in a distant corner of the world. We were amazed by the overwhelming response from all corners, requests for more information & updates, also to give a new look to the page that blends perfect with his sound & cultural integrity, & the timeless ancient land where he belongs!... not an easy task! But at last, here it is..the new website of sitarist & composer Biswabrata Chakrabarti.
