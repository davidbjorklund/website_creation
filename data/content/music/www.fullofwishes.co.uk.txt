The podcast is also available in book form but you have to pay for that - although itâs also a beautifully designed package so well worth the dollars! Ways of Hearing Artefacts #008: Luna - Going Home (demo) flexidisc Posted by Andy on 19 July 2019 in categories: lost tracks luna artefacts audio This demo version of Lunaâs Going Home was released on a flexidisc given away with issue 48 of The Bob magazine. To be honest Iâm not too sure how this came into my possession, the stickers suggest I bought it at a Notting Hill Gate Record & Tape Exchange for Â£1.50 (thereâs a cheaper price stuck to the back of the disc) - but I donât remember doing that, although I bought a lot of stuff from the exchanges so itâs perfectly possible. Maybe I was sent it by another fan (thanks if I did that and it was you) or I bought it on eBay or Discogs (but canât find any evidence of that). Anywayâ¦ I have a copy!

Limited edition blue swirl vinyl release of Galaxie 500's This Is Our Music Posted by Andy on 12 July 2019 in categories: galaxie 500 news Blue swirl This Is Our Music Galaxie 500's final album is getting a limited edition re-release exclusively through Newbury Comics . Following on from the lovely orange vinyl On Fire released earlier in the year, 20|20|20 are releasing a blue swirl vinyl copy of Galaxie 500âs brilliant (and criminally under-appreciated) final album This Is Our Music. The album pressed from the 2009 remaster will be available exclusively through independent record shop Newbury Comics and is limited to 500 copies. The record is available to order now and will be released on the 19th July. Galaxie 500's ambitious final album, remastered for LP in 2009. The nine song set originally recorded in 1990 includes their cover of Yoko Ono's 'Listen, the Snow is Falling'. This Is Our Music Exclusive LP Artefacts #007: CDR of Luna and Lou Reed playing Ride Into The Sun Posted by Andy on 12 July 2019 in categories: artefacts luna I canât find the accompanying communication that came with this but my memory is that Dean Wareham asked me not to make public this recordingâs provenance - but, given that he himself shared this recording on Soundcloud after Louâs passing in 2013, I guess itâs OK for me to say that this CDR was sent to me by Dean back in 2004 specifically to put on A Head Full of Wishes. Thatâs Deanâs handwriting on the CDR and it clearly says that it was live in Boston 1996 but this is the same recording as the one on Soundcloud that claims to be from the following nightâs show in NYC. Unless Dean wants to clarify Iâm going to assume he was right when he wrote it on the CDR! I didnât get too many exclusives for AHFoW so this was quite exciting - and was, for many years the most downloaded mp3 I ever shared and still periodically gets folk happening upon it. You can download the recording over here in both mp3 and flac formats - or you can stream the Soundcloud version which has a few seconds before, and after the track you get to hear Lou thanking Dean and Luna.

Artefacts #006: Tickets for the UK premiere of 13 Most Beautiful Posted by Andy on 8 July 2019 in categories: artefacts dean & britta Sneaking an extra artefact in this week as today is the 10th anniversary of the first UK performance of Dean & Brittaâs splendid 13 Most Beautiful: Songs for Andy Warholâs Screen Test that happened at the Carnegie Hall in Dunfermline, Scotland. So, todayâs artefact are our tickets from the fantastic show. You can read my gushings from ten years ago here . Thereâs some very low-res video of some of the show on youtube - but the audioâs tolerable so nice to listen to, so Iâve converted them to mp3: Audio: Not A Young Man Anymore Source: 8th July 2009 - Dean & Britta - Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline, UK Audio: It Don't Rain in Beverly Hills / Silver Factory Theme Source: 8th July 2009 - Dean & Britta - Carnegie Hall, Dunfermline, UK I thought Iâd just go through some of the stuff Iâve acquired over the years and post about it hereâ¦ how interesting the posts (and artefacts) are will undoubtedly vary! Artefacts #005: Letter from Naomi, July 1997 Posted by Andy on 5 July 2019 in categories: artefacts damon & naomi Back in 1997, in the wake of the heartbreaking Ptolemaic Terrascope interview , I wrote a fan letter to Damon & Naomi. To be honest I canât remember if this was a real letter or an email. In my head it was a real letter with a stamp and everything. But that maybe the romantic in me trying to convince myself that Iâd written a proper, old fashioned fan letter. For the sake of argument letâs assume that it was real. This was, Iâm fairly certain, the first fan letter Iâd written to anyone. I had previously joined the Motorheadbangers fan club but donât remember ever sending Lemmy a gushing letter. The response I got was this lovely, and very real, letter from Naomi where she touches on the PT interview, and the first Terrastock festival. Thereâs more beneath the envelope butâ¦ I need some secrets. The last line read: Congratulations on your new baby That new baby graduated from university last month.

But I feel all right when you smile Posted by Andy on 4 July 2019 in categories: galaxie 500 INT. WEST LONDON VICTORIAN TERRACE HOUSE - THURSDAY MORNING - BREAKFAST The dining table is a mess. ANDY, HAZEL and ADAM are sitting down to eat their porridge. One cat is milling around, another is sitting on the table. The radio is playing faintly in the kitchen. ANDY Wait! Is that Galaxie 500 on the radio? listens intently ANDY No. Shhh. It is, it's Galaxie 500. On the radio! Andy looks out of the window ANDY B-b-b-but, it's not snowing, why are Galaxie 500 on the radio? Adam walks into the kitchen and turns up radio ANDY Ohhh! (reddens with embarrassment) Hazel and Adam roll their eyes and get on with breakfast Long, awkward pause HAZEL Shouldn't you be going to work? (under her breath) Every flipping year! Happy Galaxie 500 day - or whatever else you might choose to celebrate on this day. Galaxie 500 - Fourth of July Video: New video for Dean Wareham's cover of Wand'rin' Star Posted by Andy on 1 July 2019 in categories: dean wareham video Wand'rin' Star - Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre (dir: Judith Berndsen / edited: Britta Phillips) Dean Wareham has just released this video for his cover of the Lee Marvin classic Wandârinâ Star from the excellent Dean Wareham vs Cheval Sombre album . Dean Wareham - Wand'rin' Star If you havenât heard the Lee Marvin original you really should, itâs a masterpiece! Lee Marvin - Wand'rin' Star Artefacts #004: Romantica promo stickers Posted by Andy on 28 June 2019 in categories: artefacts luna When Luna released Romantica Dean sent me a promo CD and a bunch of these stickers - one was inscribed For Adam love Dean - when Romantica came out Adam wasnât even five so wasnât getting his sticker. He still hasnât got it. One did find itâs way onto one of my record boxes but I still have three (including Adamâs) filed away.

A Tribute to Luna and Dean Wareham at The Social Posted by Andy on 22 June 2019 in categories: luna review To celebrate the release of the sixth single in the Sonic Cathedral singles club the fab London indie put on a celebration of all things Luna and Dean at The Social on Thursday night. Sadly for reasons of geography no members of Luna could make an appearance so it was very much a fan driven endeavor - and Sonic Cathedral managed to put together a wonderful evening. I arrived early with a box of CDs and singles as A Head Full of Wishes was acting as DJ for the evening - received a bit of training on the kit and started playing a few tracks while the rest of the room was working to get the evening going.
