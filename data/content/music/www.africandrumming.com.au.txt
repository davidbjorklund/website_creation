At African Drumming we are respectful of the limited resources mother nature has afforded us. We are dedicated to giving back to our planet and balancing our environmental imprint. As such, we have started two Tree planting initiatives across two continents. In Ghana our joint venture with registered NGO Denyigba is an exciting opportunity to re-forest hardwood mahogany. Every time we sell an African drum, we plant and nurture a new Hardwood tree. Whilst in Indonesia we are putting 5% of funds from the sale of every drum towards the ‚ÄúEast-Java Plant a Tree Program.‚Äù Through these programs you can be sure that when you purchase a drum from African Drumming you are giving back to our planet. Stay tuned for more updates and pictures as our projects evolve!
