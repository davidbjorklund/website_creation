Download for the sound but, if you want more than just the waves, select Coup d&#39;etat for a rendezvous with the artist. Influences of Bob Dylan are obvious and Paul McCartney has certainly helped to guide the ear of the craftsman. Coup d&#39;etat is a passionate collection of war and love, gut-wrenching and heart-lifting. You can spend the whole 53 minutes and 9 seconds lost in the details of the sleeve and you&#39;ll still discover more the next time. </p> <p><i>$20</i></p> UPPER POSTER   NEWS Updated July 20, 2019 Commissioned by CTV, Chris composes "Kelsey's Back" for their 30-second promo spot.
