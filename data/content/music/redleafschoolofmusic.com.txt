Learn how and what you want to l...earn! I've taken lessons there for 5 years my daughter was in the youth rock group there for 4 years - can't say enough good things about the programs at this small school" Spencer Dec. 12, 2013  "I wanted to get the word out about Red Leaf School of Music and Geno Stroia. This place is very cool, very clean, very organized and not at all a typical hole in the wall "school of music." What sold me on it were the guitar strings in the vending machine next to healthy snacks!! I look forward to teaching and hosting masterclasses here some day." Patrick Apr. 17, 2013 "I wanted to thank you for teaching me how to play the guitar, but more importantly, for teaching me how to understand and relate to the music I'm playing."
