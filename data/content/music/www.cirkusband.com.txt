The quality of the tape, while not as good as when new and certainly not as good as the long lost original tape, was still quite salvageable. Great for nostalgic reasons if nothing more. Audio was likewise good, relatively speaking.      Casablanca 2003 Lincoln Reunion Video The complete 2003 Lincon Theater Reunion Show has been restored to full size DVD quality with completely remastered audio. Previously, this video was available as a small 320*200 rendering only, with less than stellar audio.      The Lincoln Theater 2012 Southland Ballroom Video The complete 2012 Southland Ballroom Show, the last show the band will ever play as Cirkus, has been restored to full size with completely restored audio. The video is a "camera at the back of the room with somewhat distorted audio", but it's a great record to close out what has been a wonderful experience.      Southland Ballroom Restored and Remastered As an added bonus, all full-performance audio files and albums have been remastered for much better audio quality. This has been done for both streaming multimedia and albums. Plus, the streaming audio and video files have been embedded with on-page playback. No longer is there a need to download files for listening (although downloading is still available by right clicking in the playback controls). All audio files are now in MP3 format and video in MP4 — finally stopped using WMA and WMV formats at long last.      All Streaming Audio and Video      All Albums and DVD click to close SPLASH DATA END ------------------------------------------- SPLASH FINISH --------------------------------------------- FACEBOOK -------------------------------------------------- <div id="fb-root"></div> <script>(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = "//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk')); </script> FACEBOOK -------------------------------------------------- <td id="facebook" valign="top" align="right" nowrap> <div class="fb-like" data-layout="standard" data-href="http://www.cirkusband.com" data-send="true" data-width="266" data-show-faces="true" data-colorscheme="dark" data-font="trebuchet ms" style="margin:0px; padding:4px 4px 4px 4px; border: 0px outset #888888; background-color:#000000; box-shadow:5px 5px 60px 10px black;"></div> </td> <table width="100%" cellpadding="40" cellspacing="40" border="0"> <tr> <td width="25%">&nbsp;</td> <td align="left" nowrap style=" width:50%; min-width:760px; max-width:1000px; background-color:rgb(022,022,022,0.78); // border-style:ridge; // border-width:6px; // border-spacing:20px; // border-color:#ffffff; // border-radius:10px; box-shadow:5px 5px 80px 20px black;"> <a class="i" href="./memoriam/index.html"><img class="shadowed" width="250" src="./logos/memor.png"></a> <a class="i" href="./memoriam/sean/index.html"><img style="position:relative; top:0px; left:0px; margin:12px;" align="right" height="160" border="4" src="./memoriam/sean/thumbs/fb_sean_15.jpg"></a> <a href="./memoriam/sean/index.html"><h1 class="memorsml">Sean Carmichael</h1> <h4 class="memorsml">August 14, 1957 - January 22, 2019</h4></a> <table> <tr><td align="left"><b>Death leaves a heartache no one can heal, but love leaves a memory no one can steal.</b></td></tr> <tr><td align="right"><b>&#151;<i>Irish proverb</i></b></td></td> </table> </td> <td width="25%">&nbsp;</td> </tr> </table> Recent Activity In Memoriam In Memoriam Cirkus 2012 Cirkus 2012 Cirkus 2011 Cirkus 2011 Cirkus 2009 Cirkus 2009 Cirkus 2007 Cirkus 2007 Cirkus 2003 Cirkus 2003 Cirkus 2001 Cirkus 2001   Band Members and Crew Forever Remembered   The Last Show Ever at The Southland Ballroom   The Michael Gardner Benefit & LIVE BAR   Cheating The Reaper Concert and DVD Recording   What a blast!!!!   Where you there?   The Lincoln Reunion Concert! …yeah…etc…   What do you expect after 18 years?

Welcome to our website! This website is in tribute to all of the people that were involved in this project over the years. It should not be construed as a "they're living in the past" kind of thing as that wouldn't be the case at all. We have all gone on to lead normal, middle class lives (the ones we know about, anyway!) but are linked forever by an experience that none of us would trade for anything. We are proud of the work we did, and we are pleased to have an outlet that allows us to share our experiences, if for no other reason than to say, "Here's what we were doing way back then, and it was special!" Cirkus was a rock and roll band that was in existence from 1978 to 1983 . Through many personnel changes as well as changes in the basic songlist , Cirkus worked hard to become one of the most prominent bands on the club scene throughout North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia. They traveled hard, played hard, and partied hard. There was nothing subtle about Cirkus, it was more of a sledgehammer approach—crank up those Marshalls and let's rock, boys! From the opening song to the last call for alcohol, Cirkus rocked the house harder than any club band in that area leaving the crowd sweaty, breathless and screaming for more. It was not uncommon for booking agents to advise their young, inexperienced bands to "go see Cirkus and you'll see how it's supposed to be done." Cirkus' main mission was that the band was going to have a great time and they wanted the crowd to, as well. Even if there were relatively few people in the club (and there were those nights!), the band wanted those few people to go home and call their friends so that there weren't as few people there the next time. It was obvious to the attendees that they were in for something out of the ordinary upon just walking into the club. They were greeted with lots of lights, a huge P.A. system, large stacks of amplifiers, and a massive drum kit. When the house lights and music went down and the band took the stage, Cirkus began kicking ass and taking names, and the crowd knew they were in for a thrill ride. Want to be convinced? Check out the crowd noise heard an the Carowinds Concert ! They had their problems, sure. Bad management decisions, bad personnel decisions, band vehicles of questionable safety, equipment problems, you name it. They were lucky, though, in that nobody ever got seriously hurt (see below), arrested (it was close a couple of times!) or chased by irate husbands (also, close!). They made it through alive and mostly in one piece. They never attained the ultimate goal, the ever-elusive recording contract, but they had one hell of a good time. It was good to be king, indeed. To all of the wives and girlfriends who endured the hectic frenzy, to all of the players and road crew who participated, to all the club owners who allowed us to play your venue, to all the parents who supported us and allowed us to pursue our fantasy, to all of the people who we became friends with (some of whom we still are friends with, and you know who you are!), and to all of the fans who packed the clubs night after night, THANK YOU! It was one hell of a ride, and none of it would have been possible without you.
