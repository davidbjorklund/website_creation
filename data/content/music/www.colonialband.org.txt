Riposa in Pace, Gene Carrescia It is with profound sadness that we announce the death of our wonderful friend and colleague, Eugene (Gene) Carrescia. A longtime member of the Colonial Band, Gene passed away on May 7th at Leominster Hospital after battling pneumonia for several weeks. He was 93 years old. A trumpet phenom since his teens, Gene always brought excitement and panache to his playing, featuring a broad vibrato and beautiful tone. His return to the band in the 1980s was such a great closing of a musical circle that began in his youth. He was a veteran of the big band era, and had wide experience from circuses to Dixieland bands, big bands and star shows. To us, he was the connection that bound our current edition of the band to the days of old, when the band was led by Gaspare Bisceglia and rehearsed at the old Foggia Club. But he was so much more than that. A section mate, an advisor, a friend. And a sublime musician.
