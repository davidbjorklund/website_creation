Welcome - Denny Diamond | a Neil Diamond Tribute End Facebook Pixel Code The Neil Diamond Story The Greatest Hits and The Stories Behind The Songs A Powerful and Engaging Performance "Denny brings natural warmth to your heart and a new breath of life to Neil Diamond's music. Denny as Neil Diamond sound like Americana: Warm, comforting - just what you expect! Captivating! Energetic! Charismatic! A guaranteed crowd pleaser and a sold out show" Laura Witlox Friends of Woodstock Opera House It almost seemed as though folks had come prepared for such a request – had been practicing for weeks. The sweetest sound came rising up from the back of the house to the front. Then came the resounding finale, “So Good! So Good! So Good!” which is what this concert was. Ken Buell Rosemary Claussen PAC Full of comedic banter and honest moments, Denny performed with his two sons, Lucas and Spenser...the group played an incredible hour of what Denny called "feel good" music, celebrating the man who brought the world hits such as "Sweet Caroline" and "Coming to America."
