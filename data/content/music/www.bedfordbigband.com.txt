From outdoor concerts to elegant dinner dances, fund raisers, weddings and anniversary parties -- we do it all! We are fun and stylish and truly everyone loves Swing and Big Band music! Outfitted in tuxes and ball gowns or more casual if the event calls for it -- no matter what, we will remind everyone of the elegant and awesome bands of the 1930's and 40's. Our repertoire includes many of your favorite jazz and Big Band standards, Latin rhythms, waltzes, R&B, as well as some exciting contemporary arrangements that you're sure to enjoy. We have great vocals and instrumentals, we are a crowd pleaser and work with those who hire us to make the music just right for the occasion. Our price includes a professional sound engineer and lighting that is tailored for each site. Visit our gallery to see how we look in various venues. Check out our calendar for upcoming events and come see us at one of our free public performances.
