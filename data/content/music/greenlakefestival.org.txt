James Ehnes , 2019 Grammy Winner for Best Classical Instrumental Solo, and Andrew Armstrong , internationally acclaimed pianist performing and all-Beethoven recital Spektral Quartet , whom The New Yok Times wrote, “they have everything, a supreme technical command that seems to come easily, a capacity to make complicated music clear, and most notably…an ability to cast a magic spell” Suwannee Swing Saloon , an American classic reborn! From the sorrowful laments of the lonesome cowhand on the prairie to the whimsical jubilations of Radio City Music Hall, they bring you a rare look into the unlikely blend of culture and attitudes which distinguish this one-of-a-kind genre of music. All concerts are FREE to make it easier for young families to introduce their children to the wonderful world of music.
