More » The Music Department offers students an exceptionally wide variety of opportunities to study music both inside and outside the classroom through performance, composition, ethnomusicology, theory, and history. The faculty is made up of devoted teachers, prominent scholars, prolific composers, and active performers. We offer numerous courses for both the major and the general student and high-level performance opportunities that are open to all students at Williams. Our majors receive a great deal of personal attention and nearly 500 students participate in music at Williams each year. The Department presents approximately 125 concerts a season ranging from student recitals and ensembles to visiting artists of national and international stature. As a premiere liberal arts college, Williams encourages students to explore the full range of musical studies and to seize as many opportunities as possible during their all-too-brief college years.
