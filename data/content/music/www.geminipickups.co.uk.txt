About Gemini Pickups navig_begin blog navigation start blog navigation end navig_end   Tempdesignbegincontent2   Tempdesignendcontent2   Gemini Pickups offers one of the largest and the most varied ranges of guitar and bass pickups available. We have all the humbuckers, strat and tele pickups you could want, and a lot more besides including Rickenbacker and Jazzmaster. We have lots of mini humbucker models. If you're not a convert, you should check some out. As well as some great classic P90's, we have some very different ones, like the Seraphim and Cherubim. Our humbucker sized P90's have the same model names as their conventional shaped counterparts - thanks to our unique butterfly bobbin design they sound exactly the same. For bass players, we have P and J pickups aplenty and we have some stunning designs for Ricky 4000 series  and Thunderbird users. All of our pickups are handwound in the UK and all are fully guaranteed. If you're not sure exactly what you want, email us and we'll be happy to help and provide as much advice as you need.   Follow us on or  Find us on Facebook GeminiPickups   banner_begin   banner_end email_begin email_end Copyright Mike Rose 2006 -2015.
