(515) 386 - 8863 guitars@netins.net tabs-5 In 1971 I traveled to Spain to study guitar. I spoke no Spanish and knew no one. Within two days I had met the famous guitar maker Paulino BernabÃ©, who became a close friend. I asked his advice about who was the best teacher in Madrid and he said without hesitation, Regino Sainz de la Maza. Paulino called him and arranged an audition. My playing was quite poor, but somehow Don Regino accepted me as a pupil. I studied with him for seven years. It was a great privilege to have had his guidance. I got to know most of the guitar makers in Madrid; BernabÃ©, HernÃ¡ndez y Aguado, ArcÃ¡ngel FernÃ¡ndez, RamÃ­rez, to name a few. I spent a great deal of time in BernabÃ©'s shop at Cuchilleros 8 in Madrid watching him build quality guitars. The education and insight has proven invaluable. "Bajo la palmera" - Duo Llobet - Bruce's CD made with Thomas Königs is available for $15.00 which includes S&H in the US. In 1979 I went on a short trip to Germany and was offered a teaching position at a city music school in Wasserburg am Inn. I did a lot of teaching and performing. Through a friend I met a very fine guitarist, Thomas Königs , who became my duo partner. We worked exceptionally well together and in addition to performing concerts we recorded a CD of Spanish music for Aurophone. It was during my sojourn in Germany that I began dealing in fine guitars, a business that I continue to expand. My experience as a player and dealer leads me to seek out the finest guitars for the money I can find. I consider myself a caretaker of these wonderful instruments. It is a responsibility I do not take lightly. Finally, in the fall of 1998 I returned to Iowa, where I grew up. The move was rather traumatic, but we have adjusted and have met some wonderful people. Who knows where the future will take us? One thing is sure - I will always have a few fine guitars around. Bruce Banister Fine and Rare Guitars Inc.
