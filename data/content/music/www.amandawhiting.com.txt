You can understand why Amanda started the harp at 6 after being mesmerised by Harpo Marx on tv. Her classical roots were cemented after being accepted into Wells Cathedral Music School where she was the first harpist to obtain a scholarship as a Specialist Musician. Her teachers over the years included Gillian Green, Ann Griffiths, Caryl Thomas and Park Stickney. Her BMus Degree and LRSM in Harp were followed in 2013 with a Masters in Jazz (the first known harpist in the UK) and Amanda has since been a pioneer in Jazz harp in the UK. She currently teaches at The Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama, Cardiff and The Royal Birmingham Conservatoire and has recently tutored at RNCM and Junior RNCM. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Performer, Composer, Educator, Recording Artist .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Performer Amanda has many threads to her stage performances.
