If you select "Save and Scan" below, we'll run a test to see how it'll affect your tracks and show you the results before we process. Otherwise, scans are run nightly, but only process additions. If you need to use a rule to remove tracks from your site or add tracks that were previously removed, you need to "Save & Scan" it. Ingest Default: Do Not Ingest Ingest In lieu of other rules or settings, should current and new music be ingested into Content ID? Publishing Default: No Yes Should we also collect on your publishing rights? Ownership Default: Set where you have Content ID rights for your tracks. By default, we assume "WW" which means worldwide. Click here for country codes. Seperate with "|" pipe and precede with "-" minus to negate. Ex. "WW|-US" means everywhere but the US. Ask for help at contentid@sourceaudio.com . Custom Rules: Adding rules below can modify your default settings above. For instance, if your site default is "Do Not Ingest", but you set Label A to "ingest". Then any new tracks added to that label will be added to Content Id. Rules are executed from top to bottom. Ownership Publishing? Ingest?

Below are the columns you can include (capitalization is not important): SourceAudio ID (required): The id of the track you want to ingest. It's included automatically in any export. Ingest : Can be set to "yes" or "no". If the column is not included, we assume "yes". If the column is "no", we'll remove that track from Content ID if it's there, and it won't be added by the nightly scans. Publishing : Can be set to "yes" or "no". If the column is not included, we assume "no". If the column is "no", we'll remove that track's publishing rights. Ownership : Set where you have Content ID rights for your track. If the column is not included, we inherit your global setting above, and if that's not set, we assume "WW" which means worldwide. See above for details. The other columns (title, filename, etc) will be ignored, but you can leave them in if that helps you organize. The import will just add the tracks and settings you have in your CSV to whatever is currently in the system for your site, it will not remove anything not specifically referenced in the CSV.

Use the {$catalogs} tab to create some! Create a New Rule X clear Create Rule You haven't added any rules yet. Use the panel on the right to set some up! Rules let you assign batch metadata to tracks so you don't have to edit hundreds of tracks to apply a change like "set all of artist Jon Bovi's tracks to genre Rock". Give it a shot! It's pretty easy. Order Rule Options Why does order matter? Your rules will execute in ascending order, i.e., lowest first. So for example, if you have a track T in label L with album A, and two rules, one that says "If album name is A, set genre to G1" and one that says "If label name is L, set genre to G2", the order becomes important. If the first rule is order 1, the first runs first, sets the genre to G1, and then the second rule runs and sets the genre to G2. If the rules were in the reverse order, the genre would end up as G1 instead. Run Rules {order} {english} If a track's + add condition Then set its + add result Select which music providers you want to show up in your searches.

You haven't subscribed to SA Detect yet! SA Detect gives you the most accurate reporting of your music across the most highly watched broadcast and cable channels in the US.Watermarking, not fingerprinting, powers SA Detect. Why?

But get this - SA Detect, unlike any other music monitoring solution preceding us, can tell you if your music was used in programming or advertising!And if we determine it was used in advertising, we can tell you if it was in a brand commerical, network promo, or ad for a major film release (i.e., movie trailer).

Resubscribe to Detect Unsubscribe to Detect Unpaid Invoices Past Invoices The Two Views of Your Dashboard Confirmed Programs and Ads SA Detect is unique from all other music detection services in that we distinguish whether your music was used in Ads or TV Programs.Since your PRO pays performances in ads and programs differently, this distinction is important.Ads encompass paid commercials and promos reported by Nielsen, while Programs encompass series episodes, movies, specials, sporting events, and other full-length programming reported by Gracenote.Confirmation of Programs and Ads is not possible until all Nielsen and Gracenote data are collected and processed, which can take up to three weeks after broadcast.This tab shows only those Programs and Ads that have been fully confirmed. The "Detections" column in this view reflects the number of times the confirmed Program or Ad has been monitored.The "Tracks" column reflects the number of unique tracks detected in the Program or Ad.The "+" sign to the right will reveal track details, including title and interested parties.Here you can also watch and listen to a clip of the video with your music as it was detected! Confirmed Programs and Ads can be filtered by Type and/or Date range and can be Exported along with the Track details into standard cue sheet or performance log formats via Excel.Of course cue sheets and promo logs will only contain tracks that have been watermarked with SA Detect. Real Time Detections This tab details track detections as they occur.The "Detected During" column always indicates the name of the Program and Episode within which the track was detected.The "Program or Ad Name" column will repeat the Program and Episode name for confirmed Programs, or indicate the Commercial or Promo name for confirmed Ads.As mentioned before, if the 3rd party data necessary for confirming the distinction between Programs and Ads has not been collected or processed, this column will display the message, "Waiting on third-party data for confirmation". You can filter by Broadcast or Cable Network, Program or Ad Type, and/or Date range, and export a detailed track detection report into Excel. What's Being Monitored and What Should I See or Not See? The list of channels currently being monitored can be found here . In the meantime, if your Dashboard is empty, here's a list of things to ask yourself before being concerned: Have I opted into SA Detect? Has my catalog been watermarked? Have my watermarked tracks been delivered to my clients? Have my watermarked tracks been used in any productions? Have any of those productions been broadcast? Have those broadcasts occurred on any of the channels being monitored by SA Detect? Did those broadcasts occur at the National level? If the answer is "No" to any of these questions, you won't see any activity in your Dashboard yet - but don't be discouraged.Keep sending those watermarked tracks to your clients and you're bound to start seeing results soon!If, however, you answered all in the affirmative, please contact us ASAP so we can troubleshoot your account accordingly.

Save Changes Loading... Alternate Columns Loading... The numbers indicate how much space a column takes up out of 100. To learn more, click here This tool allows you to choose what columns appear on most* track lists on your site. The list of all the available columns is on the right and the list of what columns you're currently using is on the left. There's a limited amount of room in your track lists so you can't have every different type of column at once. Also, some columns are inherently wider than others (the {$Album} column tends to be wider than the Length column) so rather than give you a set number of columns you could choose, we assigned each column type a weight based on how much width it usually takes up and you can choose as many columns as you want, provided the total weight of column types you put in those columns doesn't exceed a certain weight: 100. For example, the general SourceAudio site uses these columns: (at the time this was written) Title (12) {$Catalog} (11) {$Album} (15) {$Artist} (12) {$Genre} (10) Length (6) Plays (5) Added (7) You can see the weights of these columns in the parenthesis and if you add them up, it's 89, and we add 5 more because one of the columns ({$Catalog}) is showing an icon. So the total general SourceAudio weight is 94 out of 100. We could add another small column, like Key (5) or throw in another icon, like {$Album} art and we'd still be within weight. However, if we wanted to add a wider column, like {$Publishing} (12), we'd be at 106, and we'd have to get rid of something else. Notice that we don't use every bit of the available weight on the general site and you certainly don't have to either. The system will stretch existing columns to take up more room, if you give it the space to do so, and you end with a nicer presentation (in our mind) than if you cram in as much as you possibly can. Just something to think about. Don't feel like you have to get to 100 weight. Hopefully that gives you a feel for how track list columns work. There are some tradeoffs to consider when deciding what columns you want on your site but we give you the flexibility to use some different ones depending on what metadata your tracks do or don't have. Please let us know if you have any questions or problems at support@sourceaudio.com You can see how much weight each column has by looking at the number in parenthesis under Available Columns. * some smaller track lists might still use their default columns Default Results Per Page How many tracks should the track lists show by default?
