Ask what makes you come alive and go do it. Because what the world needs is people who have come alive". ­ Howard Thurman    Welcome to the digital home of Amy Carol Webb - a place where music and ministry comes alive! Born into a music­ and­ ministry family (my father was a music teacher and a gospel preacher, my mother a singer and Sunday­ school teacher), my life’s path has taken many forks to this moment. Music has taken me into many countries, cities, homes and hearts since I was a child. As a musician, I’ve seen and felt it lift and lead hearts and minds to places unfathomed. As I child I knew what I wanted to be – a musician and a minister. But life had other ideas until I dared to take this last fork in the road, enrolled in seminary and let ministry take hold. And the music plays on. Come … take the journey with me toward all that brings us alive! Music   NEWS Well … if you’re looking for news of the moment, you’re there! New Year – new website!
