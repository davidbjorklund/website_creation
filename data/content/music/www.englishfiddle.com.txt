The case is a cardboard-only digifile and can be composted at the end of its life. The CD itself is not easily recyclable (sorry), but there are a few places they can be reprocessed. Your CD will be shipped to you in recycled and compostable packaging. If you’re not too worried about having a hard-copy CD, you can always download the album in digital format from Bandcamp or iTunes. We’ll provide access for all the album artwork on Bandcamp, if you want to have all the lyrics and cover art on your device. iTunes only provides cover art. Our back catalogue of CDs comes wrapped in various formats. When we need to refresh our stocks, we will update production methods to remain as environmentally sensitive as possible, and let you know the details! .entry #content .grid_7 Join Our Email List Get info on upcoming gigs and album releases Email Address widget_content widget_form widget_container widget_listbaby Upcoming Gigs Aug 10 .tour_date Dartmoor Folk Festival,  .tour_location   Sep 14 .tour_date Torrington Music, Arts & Heritage Festival,  .tour_location   Sep 21 .tour_date Halsway Manor,  .tour_location   .widget_container .widget_calendar Social Media .widget_container .widget_social Music Player mute unmute play pause Update Required To play the media you will need to either update your browser to a recent version or update your Flash plugin . .inner_container .widget_container .widget_basic #widget_region_right_sidebar .grid_3 © 2019 Nick Wyke & Becki Driscoll.
