The resulting instruments are personal interpretations of the form and voice of historic Plains, Southwest, and Great Lakes woodlands flutes.  A colleague calls them acoustic sculptures.  I call them Contemporary North American Flutes; my efforts to contribute to an ancient, but on-going and uniquely beautiful musical tradition of this continent.  It has been an interesting journey exploring a dream that a simple flute could stir the hearts of so many with its innocent and lovely music, and an old man's vision that this music could "become important."  With all the goings-on in the ever-growing flute community, I think that much of what was envisioned is indeed coming to pass.  I am proud to have played my part. ​ ​ ​ Amon Olorin Flutes ™        Est. 1986 Ken Light            aoflutes@blackfoot.net         (406) 381-9115          73258 Lemlama Lane, Arlee, MT 59821 Copyright 2019. Amon Olorin Flutes. All rights reserved.
