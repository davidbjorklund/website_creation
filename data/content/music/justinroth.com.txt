Justin Roth is a nationally touring singer/songwriter and fingerstyle acoustic guitarist who combines an artful blend of hooks laid on a bed of brilliantly inventive guitar technique, bridging contemporary and indie/alt folk. He has toured with John Gorka and opened for some of the finest singer/songwriters, including Shawn Colvin, Martin Sexton, Darrell Scott, and David Wilcox . His guitar playing has earned him shared stages with some of the greatest fingerstyle players of today, such as Tommy Emmanuel, Andy McKee,  and Pat Donohue . Roth’s fan-funded fourth solo album,  Now You Know , which he recorded, produced, played and sang every single note himself in his home studio, was voted as one of the Top 100 Folk Albums of 2011 by Roots Music Report. “Fans of Leo Kottke or Michael Hedges will find themselves right at home with [Roth’s] intricate guitar work…beautifully written lyrics.” – San Francisco Art Magazine NEW VIDEO FROM JUSTIN News from Justin Masterwriter discount, online guitar/songwriting lessons, capos and more!
