As drummer with The Charlatans, he played the acid-coated residency at Virginia City’s Red Dog Saloon credited with kickstarting 1967’s short-lived summer of love, but soon struck out to lead the old-time hothouse jazz of his Hot Licks. Hicks had written most of his autobiography before succumbing to liver cancer in February 2016, leaving his editor Kristine McKenna and widow Clare to bring his remarkable story up to date. Bookended by Elvis Costello’s glowing introduction and McKenna’s detailed discography, plus a trove of priceless photos and memorabilia, Hicks writes with brutal honesty, vivid insight and humour as dry as the Nevada desert as he recounts The Charlatans’ brief ride, glory years with the Hot Licks and slide into chronic alcoholism, which he eventually trounces to make his late-life comeback before cancer presents a battle he can’t win. All told, a magnificent little artefact coursing with rare truths and observations. A NOTE FROM CLARE HICKS Howdy Hixters! Dan's book is officially out in the world! This was a very special undertaking for him -- he spent a couple of hours on the phone every Friday afternoon with the amazing writer Kristine McKenna sharing his life, stories and thoughts -- a rare move for a very shy guy. Kristine and I worked on putting it all together over the last year with the great guys at Jawbone Press in London -- the memoir is in Dan's original words -- he wasn't able to completely finish it before he got sick, but Kristine brings us fully to the present. It has 100 pictures and the most complete detailed DH discography on the planet! My thanks to Elvis Costello and Tommy LiPuma for their lovely words as well. So, hope you all love it! And, thanks to Dave Kaplan and Surfdog Records for the recent vinyl release I Feel Like Singin' --Dave chose Dan's faves from the Surfdog years and so happy to add that to his catalogue. http://smarturl.it/GL_Amazon We will stay in touch and let you know about future DH archival projects -- some great unreleased stuff hiding here in his studio at home in Mill Valley!
