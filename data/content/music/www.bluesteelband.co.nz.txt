I was very impressed with how you all got a little wedding party that loud singing Exponents! I think you guys playing made people get off their butts and have a good time so thank you!! IAIN AND KAYLEIGH – WEDDING I just wanted to say thank you for all your help with organising the entertainment for our ball this past Saturday. The event was a great success and everyone who attended was very impressed with your band. I have been getting a lot of really good feedback about your performance and we will definitely recommend that you be used again at our corporate events. Thank you again for everything. JULIA ERAKOVICH – BELL GULLY LAW We just wanted to touch base to thank you all so much for playing at our wedding. You were amazing, just as we’d hoped and your reviews suggested. You managed to get everyone up on the dance floor at some point, and had it cranking all evening. The array of songs was a perfect mix for our guests and you read the crowd so well! Everyone has raved about how great you were so thank you again! HANNAH AND TOM KIBBLEWHITE – WEDDING Thank you for a great gig on Thursday. You guys were not only professional, quick to set up and sharp on stage but you really got the crowd going and dancing all night long. Great songs, great sound and a really tight performance – very impressive. You guys have a great future in music! Thanks again and I would have no problem recommending you to anyone looking for a great band to entertain at any function. Please pass my thanks on to the rest of the band and I’ll definitely be in touch if we ever need a band in Auckland again. ROYAL NEW ZEALAND PLUNKET SOCIETY I just wanted to thank you so much for playing at our function. Even though we didn’t get everyone on the dance floor (engineers are hopeless when it comes to getting up on the dance floor!) the night was a huge success. Thank you so much for being part of it. I will definitely be recommending you to others. ADELE TAYLOR Thank you so much for all the hard work you and Blue Steel put into making our wedding a great success. I have never been to a wedding before where the dance floor was packed for most of the evening so you far exceeded my expectations. I found your band very professional and have already recommended you to other friends for upcoming weddings and birthday parties. The songs you played were perfect and you really played to the crowd. MELISSA ELLIOT – WEDDING We were really happy with the band and we got lots of great feedback on the song selection – thanks! Hope you’ve got a busy year lined up and if we need a band again, I’ll let you know. STEVE AND RENEE – WEDDING Blue Steel was everything we had hoped for and more. We and our guests all had a fantastic night. You and the guys were brilliant, a real hit with our guests, and totally created the fun party atmosphere we’d hoped for. All up, two very satisfied clients. We will highly recommend you to our friends. RHONDA AND MATTHEW – WEDDING Blue Steel were a great choice of entertainment for our Annual Excellence Awards. They were professional and a pleasure to deal with – and provided a great soundtrack for our evening of celebration. Plus they didn’t complain once about the horrific display of uncoordinated dancing we subjected them to. KRISTYN ANDREW – COLLIERS INTERNATIONAL Our night was a fantastic success and I have had so many people passing on great comments about Blue Steel – Sam and the band were amazing. Easy and relaxed to work with and basically just fit in with whatever I requested of them. They simply went with all my chopping and changing and made life so easy for me as the organiser. Prompt to reply to all my requests and queries. The music was spot on .. took about 3 songs for everyone to be up and on their feet dancing and really getting into it– so great reading of the crowd by Sam. I highly recommend Blue steel if you are looking for a fun and fantastic night – put simply VERY IMPRESSIVE. URSULA GLYNOS _ VITACO I want a band that really goes off” is what my CEO asked for and that’s exactly what he got! I’ve had the pleasure of seeing Blue Steel play at different events, so I knew they were good, but as far as covers bands go, you simply can’t get any better. From enquiry to quoting to the performance on the night Sam and his team were efficient, friendly and extremely professional. The buzz generated by the band spread throughout the entire venue, from the toe-tapping smokers in the garden bar, to those busting out moves with the band on the dance floor to the dude who told me.. “These guys have ****** nailed it!” Want to take your function to the next level? Get Blue Steel in, you will not be disappointed!! This band is simply amazing!
