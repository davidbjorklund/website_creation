Atwater-Donnelly | Aubrey Atwater | Elwood Donnelly Welcome Every performance is surprisingly different and always entertaining, exciting and educational with the award-winning duo Atwater~Donnelly, who provide a unique and thrilling blend of traditional American and Celtic folk music and dance, along with original songs and poetry. The highly praised husband-wife duo blends gorgeous vocals with an astounding array of instruments including the mountain dulcimer, old-time banjo, tin whistle, guitar, mandolin, harmonica, limberjacks, feet and more. Also not to be missed are Atwater~Donnelly Trio shows where Aubrey and Elwood collaborate with Cathy Clasper-Torch on violin, cello and Chinese erhu, or the Atwater~Donnelly Band combinations with John & Heidi Cerrigione on upright bass and autoharp, and Kevin Doyle, Irish step-dancer and winner of the 2014 National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) National Heritage Fellowship, the nation's highest honor in the folk and traditional arts. Another band combination is Jerimoth Hill - a six-member old-time gospel band.
