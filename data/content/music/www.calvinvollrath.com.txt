Nelson Ferguson, Nova Scotia   WELCOME TO CALVIN'S WEBSITE! Thanks for stopping by and we hope you enjoy your visit. Click here to read the newsletter 'Calvin's Chronicle - June 2019' 'The Gift' - 2019 CD Release The new CD released May 10, 2019. I'm thrilled to announce the release of my 69th album where you'll find 20 new exciting compositions in typical Calvin fashion. I have some very special guests joining me on this album. Phil Cunningham , an incredible musician from Scotland has added his brilliant accordion sound to the mix. Jeremiah McDade, a master musician from Alberta, brought his soprano saxophone in and wait till you hear this. A new and exciting sound for a fiddle album. Germain Leduc, from Quebec lent his 'French Canadian Style' piano talents on one tune. C'est Bon ! Frank Sears, from Quebec is a 'master' button accordionist and plays with so much passion and you'll hear him one one tune. Mais Oui! Jeremy Rusu, from Manitoba plays on almost all the tunes on this album. Piano & accordionist extraordinaire! And finally, Luther & the Ordinaires are a group of family & friends that gathered one night in the studio for a party. I'm sure you'll enjoy their contribution.
