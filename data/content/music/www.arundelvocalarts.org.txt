AVAS has been providing outstanding performances of diverse choral music since 1983. We pride ourselves in the diversity of our programming, including classical masterworks, operetta, pops, folk music, lighter favorites and Broadway. The chorus presents an annual series of two concerts and supports the creative environment of our community by collaborating with other local musical groups. AVAS membership is open to adults and it is the intent of the chorus membership to reflect the cultural diversity of the communities it serves. .entry-content .article-inner #post-## #main #container #colophon #main Powered by Roseta & WordPress. ©2019 Arundel Vocal Arts Society.
