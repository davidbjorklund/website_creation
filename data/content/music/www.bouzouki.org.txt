Only the finest wood is used and crafted entirely by hand. Modern technology is used in measurement, adhesives and finish to achieve perfection in sound, playability and beauty. I have chosen Greeces finest luthiers to produce these high quality bouzoukia for export to the U.S.A. I travel to Greece twice a year to place orders and see the latest designs. The examples in the photo pages are some of the most popular styles and designs. All instruments can be ordered in tetrachordo or trichordo, which means 3 or 4 course strings. The mid size is called Tsouras and the mini is called Baglama. Pickups for amplification are available at additional cost. Please call and we can discuss your questions and design ideas. Guaranteed quality and workmanship.  END content_for_index Search © 2019, BOUZOUKI WORLD Powered by Shopify Payment methods American Express Apple Pay Discover Mastercard PayPal Venmo Visa /snippets/ajax-cart-template.liquid /snippets/search-bar.liquid Search choosing a selection results in a full page refresh
