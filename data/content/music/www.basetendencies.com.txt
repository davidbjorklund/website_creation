August 9, 2018 Just letting you know that if you aren't keeping tabs on Jeordie's eBay page (click the "Store" link on the menu bar above), you're missing out. He's been pretty active on there lately, most recently auctioning off one of his stage masks made by Laney, as well as a scarf and a coat from the ACSS days. There's still some photos and guitar pics available, and keep your eyes open for more stuff to be added! May 24, 2018 Just letting everyone know that Jeordie's got some stuff up for sale on ebay . February 9, 2018 Hello, everyone -- here is a brief roundup of what's been going on the last few months. Although Jeordie has parted ways with Marilyn Manson, he has been keeping busy behind the scenes. He and Chris Goss have been working on new music, with 11 songs written so far as per Chris' post on Twitter at the end of last year. Whether this is for Goon Moon or something new is not known at this time. Jeordie has also been devoting a lot of time to painting, something he had expressed an interest in awhile back. Hopefully prints will be available at some time in the future. Also a short student horror flick, "The Quiet Room", for which Jeordie composed the soundtrack, has been making the festival round. You can follow the film on Facebook for updates. I know many of you are wondering when/if Hour of Goon will be back. Although they said they would be back in January, that did not happen. I do know that Feral Audio has since shut down, and I suspect that may have something to do with why HoG has not yet returned. If I hear anything definitive, I will let everyone know. As always, thank you all for your continued support! August 23, 2017 Sideshow Collectibles recently paid Jeordie a visit to check out his impressively massive collection of Star Wars toys. Check out the video to see what they found -- and prepare to be blown away! August 21, 2017 As you probably know, Jeordie's been keeping himself very busy in between touring with Marilyn Manson, and among the numerous artists he's collaborated with during this time is UNKLE, with whom he also worked back in 2007 on the album "War Stories". Their newest release (August 18th), "The Road: Part I" features Jeordie on bass on the track "Looking for Rain" and on guitar on "Nowhere to Run/Bandits" (on which he has writing credits as well). Other guests include Mark Lanegan, Chris Goss, Troy Van Leeuwen and Leila Moss. The record is now available for purchase on vinyl and CD at bleep.com . July 10, 2017 Marilyn Manson has announced a round of US tour dates for this Fall in addition to the previously announced festival dates, kicking off on September 27th in Silver Spring, MD and finishing up on November 5th performing as part of the lineup of Knotfest in Devore, CA. Tickets for all shows go on sale this Friday, July 14th and a full listing of all dates can be found at marilynmanson.com . No word yet as to whether or not there will be meet & greet VIP packages sold.
