Guitars are not just a business to me; they have been my life. I was a child when I attended my first guitar concert. It was legendary Andres Segovia. Mesmerized by the natural beauty of the guitar and by how two hands and six strings could fill the Shrine Auditorium, I had to learn to play. Within a few years, I was already playing professionally, and I still perform. Besides performing and teaching, it is a great pleasure for me to share my love and knowledge of the guitar by offering exceptional classical and flamenco guitars in a wide price range. Since 1992, Dan Zeff Guitars has been serving concert performers, collectors, students, and lovers of fine instruments in North America, South America, Europe, the Middle East, Asia, and Australia.
