Out of those early sessions came the blueprint forÂ Cabin Fever. Cadillac Jones then returned to AtlantaÂ to experimentÂ with the instrumentation and textures they would use in the studio. Over the course of 9 songs, the funk-jazz group layered horns, keyboards, synthesizers, and pedal steel guitar over driving beats and delicateÂ ambiance. The resulting album documents theÂ mindstateÂ of the band as they looked back overÂ their pastÂ 14 years and forward to what they would sound like next. The band still proudly wearsÂ their influences of Herbie, James, and Quincy. But with the comfort of over a decade of history under their belts, Cadillac Jones confidently blends in touches ofÂ psychedelia,Â rock, andÂ AfrobeatÂ that keep the surprises coming from the left and right channels. image content Click here to find the new Cadillac Jones album on iTunes. simple frame group content FIND US ON FACEBOOK custom html CONTACT US content Copyright 2016 Cadillac Jones JS includes Other scripts
