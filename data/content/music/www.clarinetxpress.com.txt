Clarinet Jewelry by Karen  Odds and Ends Tips for the Day   Welcome to my Website  The future  is  here Grabner HiTech Clarinet Mouthpieces After months of research and study, I am proud to announce that I am now producing my own mouthpieces from my own designs. I call them the Grabner HiTech Clarinet Mouthpieces , and they are available for all clarinets from E-flat through contra bass. My mouthpieces are produced using cutting-edge, 21st-century technologies. They are designed using CAD software and realized through very high-end additive manufacturing. The designs are traditional with subtle improvements that meet the demands placed on the 21st century clarinetist. Come see us at ClarinetFest ® 2019, in Knoxville, July 24-28. Stop by to say, “Hello.”  Over 60 mouthpieces and barrels to try! I have been asked several times why I chose additive manufacturing to produce my mouthpieces, and about the material I selected. Click here for a little bit more information. Reviews are starting to come in: Walter. I just wanted you to know this mouthpiece (S2MO) is great. I tried a couple of other reeds on it (at home) ........and it played better than ever.  I think you are indeed on to something here!!! - Howard Green, prominent Chicago area clarinetist. Walter. (Just) confirming receipt of the mouthpiece (B1C).  Tried it out last night and loved it.  Completely changed my tone in the upper register over the Vandoren I'd been using.  Thanks for your excellent craftsmanship! - Jeff Bruce ****************************************************************************************************************************** I have some Zinner-based mouthpieces available. The table below will tell you what Zinner-based mouthpieces I have left, and tell you what new model replaces them.
