In 2019-20, we will continue to celebrate the talents of GLBTQ musicians and composers. We’ll lift up works by under-represented composers, we’ll perform multiple works by living and local composers, and we’ll do all of this along side some well-known masterworks. Our season features works by Coleridge-Taylor, Dvořák, Libby Larsen, Sibelius, Mina Kaiser, Hindemith and many more! One Voice Mixed Chorus joins us in “Currents” on November 9th to perform works by Dessa and Jocelyn Hagen, Mari Esabel Valverde, and Lee Hoiby. Violist Korey Konkol and violinist Stephanie Arado are our featured soloists in “Crossings” on March 14th , performing Bruch’s Double Concerto. “Soundscapes”, on May 16th will feature Duluth composer Mina Kaiser and highlight different sections of the orchestra, finishing with the scintillating Symphonic Metamorposes by Paul Hindemith.
