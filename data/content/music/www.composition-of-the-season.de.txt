COMPOSITION of the SEASON      Home  Beginner  Advancer  Master  2 Guitars  Trios  Sextett  Friends  Contact Card Game COMPOSITION of the SEASON Welcome to COMPOSITION of the SEASON. This is the title of my compositional work. After having studied art in the seventies I started to write guitar music in 1994. As a self-taught composer I feel inspired by classical and modern composing rules but I do not obey them strictly. My pieces are subsequently pretranscribed for guitar. They should be musically polished like precious stones. Guitarists are invited to transcribe my studies into suitable guitar scores. TVbeat is my idea of a modern 'Open Ballet'. If you are a guitar performer, choreographer or dancer feel free to contact . Yours sincerely Uwe Warneke
