I was surprised at how much my practise technique differed from my time as a young learner and I do wish I had known some of these techniques then. I'm sure it would have help avoid quite a few arguments with my parents. I am also taking a course in Cinematic Orchestration with Hollywood composer and orchestrator, Charles Fernandez, and as I worked through the examples it struck me that I have always said that composition improves with practice, but now I am actually seeing (and hearing) the proof! And in amongst all this talk of technique please remember the most important thing when we play is to  enjoy playing.  If we arenât enjoying playing, how can we expect others to enjoy listening to us? Enjoy browsing the site and good luck with your practice and your playing. If there is anything practice related you think I could help you with please use the Contact form and let me know. I'll do my best to help!
