Or would you prefer to create an account ? This official Corries site is run by Gavin Browne, son of Ronnie Browne of the Corries. Ronnie brings this site the very latest Corries news, as well as definitive Corries facts from years gone by. Gavin manages the site itself, and makes sure customers for our unrivalled range of Corries merchandise get the very best service possible. We set the service up after learning from other Corries enthusiast sites that many fans could not find the Corries recordings they wanted. We realised too that we could answer those Corries questions that no one else could. You'll now find here the world's largest collection of Corries material, anywhere!
