Okay, our first banjo player Ron Colby lived in Alexandria, and passed the "Middle Spunk Creek" highway sign on I-94 quite a bit. (He now plays with our friends The Platte Valley Boys.) When the band was formed in 1968, Ron thought "The Middle Spunk Creek Boys" would make a pretty good band name. At least it's been a pretty long-lived band name!    Buy our albums online at CDBABY.com . Direct link to our albums
