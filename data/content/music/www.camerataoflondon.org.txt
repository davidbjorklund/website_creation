A modern-instrument chamber orchestra with a repertoire ranging from the early baroque to the contemporary, Camerata of London has performed in London venues including Queen Elizabeth Hall, St John's Smith Square, St Martin-in-the-Fields, St James' Piccadilly, Fairfield Halls, and in community halls and churches throughout the Southeast of England. Our membership includes young musicians starting out on their professional careers, together with a core of experienced orchestral and chamber players. Often working without a conductor, the orchestra has developed a strong sense of internal cohesion and musical vision. Our professional services to choral societies include providing an orchestra or ensemble of any size, concert planning, music hire, stage management, marketing and promotion. We also provide high quality musical entertainment for private and corporate functions and parties. We operate a number of educational programmes, including conductors' workshops, under the auspices of our parent organisation, Surrey Sinfonietta (Community Music). We are looking for sponsors to help us in our quest to bring live classical music to those who might not otherwise be exposed to it, and to develop the expertise of those already involved in making music.
