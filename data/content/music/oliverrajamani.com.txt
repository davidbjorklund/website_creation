With innovative and original compositions performed solo or in various configurations (including a large orchestral ensemble with dancers), Rajamani has created a sound of his own with the historic threads of Indian, Romani and Texas cultures and music. An Austin World Music award winner, a nominee of the 2008 US Artist Award and the 2014 nominee of the prestigious German world music award in the European Charts, Rajamani has toured internationally and has recorded and performed with poets and artists wide-ranging in style including Jeronimo Maya, Gypsy Kings, Willie Nelson, Edie Brickell, L. Shanker, Eric Johnson, Ustad Shujaat Khan, Ustad Aashish Khan, Glen Velez, Paravai Munniamma, Tomasa La Macanita, Dotschy Reinhardt, Robert Bly, Coleman Barks, Paul Maar including performing for the Maharaja of Jodhpur, India, Gaj Singh II. He has been a featured artist on the NPR BBC radio amongst numerous other radio, TV stations and magazines. Rajamani’s unique musical sound and original compositions are drawn from the spiritual and Gypsy/folk chants of India and the elegant Western orchestral/folk traditions of Europe and the lone star state of Texas.
