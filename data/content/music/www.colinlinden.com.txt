' Rich In Love ' by Colin Linden Released: September 25, 2015  Label: Stony Plain Records Order Now   Rich In Love is destined to be considered a classic and belongs in the music library of anyone with a love for music in any style. - Bill Wilson Latest News Announcement Now that Nashville has been saved (thank the TV gods!) and is moving to CMT and Hulu for season five, there's the next order of business: Which cast members will return, and which ones won't? New contracts have to be worked out among the series cast, which means just because a fan favorite was a series regular on season four, doesn't mean they'll be back for season five. (See, there's a reason they call this show business). The good news? Main stars Connie Britton (Rayna James) and Hayden Panettiere (Juliette Barnes) will return, meaning that Juliette's fateful flight home to Avery and their daughter shouldn't be the last we see of the tortured songstress. Also scheduled to return for the 22-episode fifth season, according to TVLine : Charles Esten (Deacon), Sam Palladio (Gunnar), Jonathan Jackson (Avery), Clare Bowen (Scarlett), Lennon Stella (Maddie), Maisy Stella (Daphne), and Chris Carmack (Will).   Recent Posts In Fond Memory of Gregg Allman June 6, 2017 Colin Linden Remembers Chuck Berry March 21, 2017 Rolling Stone…Hear Eric Church, Blackie and the Rodeo Kings’ Brooding ‘Bury My Heart’ October 25, 2016 Tweets by @colinlinden Disography Still Live   Easin' Back To Tennessee   From The Water   Southern Jumbo   Big Mouth   Sad Beautiful World   Raised By Wolves   Through The Storm   South at Eight North At Nine   When the Spirit Comes   Live!!   Copyright Colin Linden 2016 .
