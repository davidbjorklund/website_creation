JOHN PURSER to present an exciting new double CD release honouring the 600th anniversary of the famous battle at Harlaw - July 24, 1411. For centuries this battle has been remembered in music and poetry depicting as many conflicting stories as the battle itself. For the first time in history prominent scholars and musicians from Scotland, America, Canada, and France have collected the songs and stories on a new, beautifully illustrated and comprehensive two CD project. Disc one features Rideout's stellar fiddle playing of three ancient piobaireach: The Battle of Harlaw, Cogadh no Sith (War or Peace) , and The Battle of the Birds. Fifteen of the world's finest Celtic musicians join Rideout on this musical journey including Glenuig piping legend Allan MacDonald who sings and plays the powerful 500-year-old Gaelic incitement to the battle; Andy Hunter sings the 16th-century ballad, accompanied by Bonnie, and William Taylor on Celtic harp; and Elizabeth Stewart sings her commanding north-east Aberdeenshire version of the ballad. Several stunning solo versions of the ancient melody Battel Harloe are performed by Billy Jackson - harp, Ronn McFarlane -lute, Chris Norman - flute, Grant Herreid - theorbo, and more. On the final track, Barnaby Brown plays triple pipes reconstructed from 1000 years ago, and with Bonnie accompanying, creates a haunting and beautiful version of The Battle of the Birds . On the Narration CD, award-winning broadcaster and Scottish music historian, John Purser , tells the story of Harlaw and leads discussions with Elizabeth Stewart and Glasgow University Professor Alan Riach . Elizabeth tells a ghost story from the battlefield itself passed down from her grandfather of the Northeast travelling folk. The outstanding line-up of musicians accompanies the narration to create a beautiful and fascinating listening experience. <p> <div class="hugeB" align="center">***ANNOUNCING THE ALBUM RELEASE CONCERT ***</div> <div align="center"> <span lang=EN-GB style='font-size:18.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Engravers MT"'>HARLAW 1411<o:p></o:p></span> </div> <br> 600 years ago, the windswept fields of Harlaw in north-east Scotland were witness to one of the bloodiest of battles in Scottish history. Although forgotten by many, the Battle of Harlaw was well remembered in music and song, much of it centuries old. This double CD brings the past to life with Bonnie Rideout playing three remarkable fiddle piobaireachd in addition to a remarkable variety of instrumental and vocal gems. An accompanying narrative with Dr. John Purser tells the story of this tragic and epic event. </p> <div class="largeB">CELTIC CONNECTIONS PRESENTS:</div> <span class="italicsB">A Double CD Release Concert on January 26, 2011, 7:30 p.m. at St. Andrew's in the Square!</span> This two-part program features a stellar line-up of renowned Celtic musicians.

"Rideouts contribution to the sustaining and development the piobaireachd art form is unmatched; and this CD is a landmark, not just in the history of Scotlands music, but in the history of music for stringed instruments. These are ambitious works. Their themes are carefully constructed, and they are followed by extended variations, often thrilling in their technical demands; but their beauty and intensity amply reward both the performer and the listener."             John Purser "...the gemstone is Rideout's Pibroch..."             New York Times Dear Listeners and Friends, National Public Radio has featured both recordings; Scotland's Fiddle Piobaireachd - Volume I and II, on Fiona Ritchies Thistle and Shamrock.
