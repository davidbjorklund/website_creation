By threading the music of Elliott Smith through the dense, yet often isolating landscapes of the three major cities he lived in — Portland, New York City, Los Angeles — Heaven Adores You presents a visual journey and an earnest review of the singer’s prolific songwriting and the impact it continues to have on fans, friends, and fellow musicians. "Nickolas Rossi’s documentary is a gorgeous recounting of Smith’s life, beautiful and troublesome, and the influence he had on everyone." ~ Chad Liffman, SpinningPlatters.com END callout-wrap   Deleted Scene: “I Love My Room”   How To See Heaven Adores You   Who’s in Heaven Adores You   Heaven Adores You Reviews END main #content END main-area   END footer-top END main Heaven Adores You Updates NEW Elliott Smith Performance Footage: New Years Eve 1999 at The Knitting Factory in New York City Friend and publicist Dorien Garry was there that night: “In typical Elliott fashion he was... more» A Fond Farewell To A Friend – Upcoming Tributes To Elliott Smith On October 21st of 2003, Elliott Smith left us far too soon.
