I'm Paul and I created FooArchive in 1999 with the aim of sharing my growing collection of Foo Fighters articles with some likeminded individuals on the world wide web... and it's just kinda snowballed from there. I saw my first Foo Fighters concert in August 1995 and since then I've seen the band around 80 times. From near (Liverpool) to far (Toronto), in a stadium of thousands (Wembley) to a recording studio with a handful of others (Maida Vale).
