"My Fandrich & Sons 132V is beautiful with a beyond belief gorgeous sound. It sings in a way I've never experienced!" -- Dr. Ann Jennings "This Feurich 123V upright is other-worldly. This is the most buttery upright I ever played!" -- Mike Strickland www.mikestrickland.com "Last Sunday morning while seated at the Fandrich & Sons grand piano which you crafted for our church, I rendered one of the most sublime performances of Cesar Franck's Panis Angelicus in the history of the world! I was deeply moved in the midst of this beautiful musical prayer to realize that it was not just me making such a beautiful sound...every one of you who touched that fine instrument in its conception and fabrication had a hand in that particular piece of music last Sunday....You were not there to witness the hush and the grandeur of the moment....But I must say 'thank you' many times over for the pride and brilliance you put into your work." -- Cass Seely pianist at Our Lady of the Lake Catholic Church, regarding their Fandrich & Sons 213HGS (7'grand).
