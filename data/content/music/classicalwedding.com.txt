[ Vendors ] [ Equipment ] "Derek played such beautiful music at our cocktail hour wedding reception. He played perfect music to set the romantic mood. His live classical guitar and stonewalls of the restaurant worked so well together. Having a live classical guitar was one our favorite ideas for our reception. I would highly encourage everyone to feature Derek at their special event.. especially weddings. Thank you Derek!!"
