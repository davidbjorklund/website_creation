With a subtle but encyclopedic command of American styles and rhythms, a captivating melodic sense and incisive, clever lyrics, he is as supple a song craftsman as any riding the folk boards today." -- Scott Alarik, Boston Globe Family Recipe (9/2018) is Michael Jerling's tenth album, a collection of twelve new original songs. Included are a country ballad, "In Lieu Of Flowers," a poignant look at family with the folky "Family Recipe," a bit of fingerpicking whimsy with "That's Why Republicans Hate Trains," and a waltz-time look at European café society between the wars in with "When Words Still Mattered." Visit the album page for more about it and clips of all the songs. We have the CD in stock now in our Fool's Hill Music store. His previous albums include Halfway Home , released in 2013, and a live album, Music Here Tonight , recorded at Caffè Lena in Saratoga Springs in June 2009 and released that September.
