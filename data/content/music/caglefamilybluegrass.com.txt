We would like to say hello to everyone who visits our website. In 1999 we started playing at local churches and festivals near our hometown of Efland, North Carolina. As time went by we began to play more events and travel longer distances. The year 2001 marked the beginning of our first ten day tour to the Midwestern and southern states. That same year we began recording our second album entitled, "Stepping Out" which was released in 2002. Our third all gospel album, "The Gift" produced by Steve Dilling of IIIrd Tyme Out was released in 2003. After the release of our third album our travels took us further north as well as down to the deep south. Many of the states we have toured include Missouri, Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi, Wisconsin, New York, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Florida, Georgia and S.C. There have been several tours since 2001 and many miles traveled. As a band we always look forward to where our music will take us next. Currently life has taken each of us in different directions, but we still find the opportunity to gather for bluegrass pickings, festivals, and occasional bookings.
