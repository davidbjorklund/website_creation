This is a fun and intensive week of saxophone study that deals with all aspects of saxophone performance. Students will perform in a large saxophone ensemble comprised of soprano through bass saxophones, work in smaller duets, trios, and quartets, and even attend sessions on jazz and improvisation. The workshop is tailored to meet the individual needs of our participants of all levels. If you are an enthusiastic student of the saxophone and really love playing, then this is the event for you. Instructors for the week are Robert Haley, Ravan Durr, Thomas Giles and Emma Haley. Their many decades of direct experience, both teaching and performing, will benefit every attendee and provide multiple insights into all facets of the instrument. The cost of the workshop is $200 and can be paid in two installments. Enrollment is limited to 30 participants. - <p><span><a href="http://classicwinds.com/images-cw/SawWorkshop2015.pdf" mce_href="/images-csol/SaxWorkshop2015.pdf" target="_blank" title="2015 Workshop Announcement">Download our workshop announcement here.</a></span></p> <p><span> </span></p> - Download the workshop application here.   - <p style="text-align: center;" mce_style="text-align: center;"><! - <p>The annual Saxophone Performance Workshop has now come and gone and will go down in history as the most complete and possibly the best workshop we've ever conducted. 24 outstanding saxophonists from the area attended and joined enthusiastically into chamber music, solo playing, and large ensemble rehearsals.

Most saxophonists are very familiar with the famous Concerto by Alexander Glazunov.  It is easily one of the most often studied and performed works in the repertory.  There has been a resurgence of interest in the work from an historical viewpoint, so much so that there will be a presentation at the World Saxophone Congress meeting in July on this topic.  While this type of examination of the repertoire of a particular instrument is commonplace among other instrumentalists, it is not alway so with the saxophone.  I believe the primary reason is that our body of music is relatively young, as is our instrument, and, therefore, has not attracted the scholarly examination into the origins or performances of the music.  However, the new edition of the Glazunov Concerto from Baerenreiter, the new edition of the Debussy Rhapsodie from Henle , along with publications from Ethos, are presenting just this type of critical study of our music.

The Rascher Saxophone Quartet has a brand new recording!  We are pleased to be able to present this unique presentation of Bach's Die Kunst Der Fuge , (The Art of the Fugue). The music of Bach has been a central programming pillar of the RSQ  since the quartet's inception way back in 1969.  Over the last 43 years , they have opened nearly every chamber concert with his music, or they have played his fugues as encores after hundreds of concerto performances worldwide.  And for years, the listening public has requested a Bach CD from the Rascher Quartet.  Finally the dream is a reality.   Last Updated on Wednesday, 25 April 2012 19:22 Read more...   More Articles...
