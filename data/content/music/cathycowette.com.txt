Cathy Cowette: Singer and Guitar Player  Home   Biography   Music   Online Store   Reviews/Articles   Photo Album   Dates   Mailing List   Contacts  start page body An extraordinary singer/guitar player Cathy plays the music of the great singer/songwriters like Gordon Lightfoot, Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. Her arrangements and fingerpicking patterns are inventive and original; eerily like the original recordings, yet never exact copies. She picks up the signature sound of the songs yet plays in a fresh and original way. When she sings, the style is her own yet she remains true to the songwriter's intent. Cathy has just released her first CD, Songs For A Winter's Night , a beautiful collection of fingerpicking and strumming, with wonderful arrangements by the very talented Bob Doidge.
