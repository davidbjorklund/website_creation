We feel really sorry and we are praying that things can work out as well as possible. I really hope that Japanese workers manage to cool down the power plants as soon as possible. I still remember the feeling I had when we played in Japan with Atomic Swing right after the Kobe earthquake. Some fans that had bought tickets didn't show up at the gig. Maybe some of them were lost in the earthquake (very strange feelings at that time..). But the thing I remember most is how the Japanese audience really lived out their lives and had a good time despite all sad things that had happened. I'm very impressed of Japan and the Japanese spirit! I'm still following all news about the disaster in Japan and I hope everything will end up in a way that is as good as possible. I heard that you even in Tokyo have to use less electricity and that small earthquakes still going on pretty often. Someday, somehow, I hope something good will come out of it all... Good luck to you from the whole of my heart! Your friend Petter Orwin ------------------------------------------ Petter gave to me a music file via internet. I put the file here. - Feed My Dreams It's not Atomic Swing, by Petter Orwin and Stefan Westberg. Petter is the one who originally wrote text and music, arranged, played all instruments including the bass and singed by Stefan Westberg who Petter plays together sometimes. Thank you, Petter!!!
