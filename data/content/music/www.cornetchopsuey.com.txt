The seven piece band plays dixie to bop as well as pop tunes in a show style. The band is named after an obscure Louis Armstrong composition and performs a Louis Armstrong set at most festivals. They are best known for a wide variety of styles. This well-traveled band has toured across the country playing over 17 various festivals in one year alone as well as performances in Europe, South America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand and Germany among others. The band's unique front line with Brian Casserly on trumpet, Tom Tucker on cornet, Jerry Epperson on reeds and Brett Stamps on trombone is driven by a powerful rhythm section consisting of Paul Reid on piano, Jay Hungerford on bass and Dick Maley on drums. Many of the musicians in the band are educators as well as performers and have performed with other popular festival bands prior to forming into one of America's hottest jazz bands. Chop Suey applies its own exciting style to traditional jazz, swing, blues and "big production" numbers. Every performance by Cornet Chop Suey is a high-energy presentation and is always a memorable experience for the audience.
