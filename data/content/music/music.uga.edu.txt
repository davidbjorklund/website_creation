UGA Doctoral Student Wins National Audition with the Premiere U.S. Navy Band, Washington D.C. 04/22/2019 The Hugh Hodgson School of Music is proud to share that second-year DMA student and graduate saxophone teaching assistant Harrison Clarke has recently won a position with the U.S. Navy Band, Washington, D.C., after competing against over 70 saxophonists from across the country. Positions in premiere military bands open up only when a current member of the band retires or leaves the band, which is what makes them so competitive. The nearly 12-hour audition process included three rounds and an interview before a winner was determined.    News Archive /.content /.block /.section, /#sidebar-first /.content /.block Community Resources Undergraduate Graduate Community Music School Summer Camps String Project Workshops, Festivals, Symposia & Study Abroad Hire A Student Sign up for email announcements /.content /.block More Options Faculty/Staff Positions Maestro Login Suggestion Box UGA Marketplace fee payments Health and Safety Information Tech Support for HHSOM /.content /.block /.section, /#sidebar-first /#main, /#main-wrapper /.content /.block Search form Search /.content /.block /.section, /#sidebar-first Franklin College of Arts and Sciences, University of Georgia Connect with HHSOM Privacy Policy /.section, /#footer /#page UGA Quicklinks /#page-wrapper
