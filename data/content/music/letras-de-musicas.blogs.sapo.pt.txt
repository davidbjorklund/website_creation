My sign is vital, my hands are cold And I'm on my knees looking for the answer Are we human or are we dancer? Pay my respects to grace and virtue Send my condolences to good Give my regards to soul and romance They always did the best they could And so long to devotion You taught me everything I know Wave goodbye, wish me well You've gotta let me go Are we human or are we dancer? My sign is vital, my hands are cold And I'm on my knees looking for the answer Are we human or are we dancer? Will your system be alright When you dream of home tonight? There is no message we're receiving Let me know, is your heart still beating? Are we human or are we dancer? My sign is vital, my hands are cold And I'm on my knees looking for the answer You've gotta let me know Are we human or are we dancer? My sign is vital, my hands are cold And I'm on my knees looking for the answer Are we human or are we dancer? Are we human or are we dancer?

I don't know what to think He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring And said, marry me Juliet You'll never have to be alone I love you and that's all I really know I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress It's a love story baby just say yes Oh, oh, oh, oh 'Cause we were both young when I first saw you   Vê o vídeo da música Love Story Tags: blog , fearless , letras de músicas , love story , músicas , taylor swift , vídeos Publicado por Admin às 02:37 Link do post | Comentar | Adicionar aos favoritos Quarta-feira, 27 de Janeiro de 2010 Lucky - Jason Mraz Do you hear me?
