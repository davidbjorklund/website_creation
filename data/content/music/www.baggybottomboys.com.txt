The Lord continues to bless our ministry!  Our goal is to share our faith with others and to tell them about Jesus Christ through our music. Take a minute to browse our photo page and to see the blessings that God has given us! We hope that you enjoy our Web-site! Country Gospel Music We are a Country Gospel Music Group . Our style is "Classic" in every way, and we do some of the old hymns that we all know and love. The Lord has also blessed us with a lot of our own songs that we have written, and some of them have powerful testimonies behind them. We love to do songs that have a message, and we've been amazed at how God continues to use them to reach people for Him.   Our Town We are from the Fort Worth, Granbury, Burleson area . We have performed at various  churches all around and we would love to help you in your worship services, or special events.
