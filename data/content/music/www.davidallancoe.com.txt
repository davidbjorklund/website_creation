DAC666 About David Allan Coe Ex-con found living in a cave!: David Allan Coe was the outlaw even outlaws were leery of coming across. He spent 20 years in prison for offenses including armed robbery and claimed to have killed a man who threatened him with sexual assault in a prison shower. When a reporter challenged this story, Coe wrote. “I’d Like to Kick the Shit Out of You” in his honor. In the ’70s, Coe recorded two albums of X-rated and racist tunes, with titles like “Cum Stains on My Pillow” and “N*gger Fuckers.” Money troubles followed. He lived in a cave in Tennessee after the IRS seized his home in the ’80s, and in 1990, Feds stormed a stage to repossess a guitar right out of Coe’s hands. He recently recorded with members of Pantera and toured with Kid Rock. “It’s hurt my career because I’m not a pussy and a yes-man. Nevertheless, I’m the motherfucker who has to live with David Allan Coe the rest of his life.” READ MORE DAC666 David Allan Coe Hospitalized #post-1966 David Allan Coe Tour Dates For 2018 #post-1943 New DAC Live Video #post-1923 World Premiere of the new David Allan Coe track with the Moonshine Bandits #post-1913 Country Rap Video Coming Soon #post-1903 RIP Johnny Rebel 1938-2016 #post-1886 DAC666 Share this page Facebook Twitter Google+ #content .wf-container .wf-wrap #main !Footer !Bottom-bar Featured Music On Bargain Mail Order Site Designed By Louisville VIP Bottom .wf-container-bottom .wf-wrap #bottom-bar #footer #page Facebook Comments Plugin for WordPress: http://peadig.com/wordpress-plugins/facebook-comments/
