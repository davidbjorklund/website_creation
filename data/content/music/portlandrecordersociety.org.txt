The recorder is a serious instrument with sizes and voices in every octave. Furthermore the recorder is a gateway to many forms of early to modern music and especially the delights of playing in social groups. We  hold monthly recorder playing sessions for amateurs, publish an email newsletter, support a performance orchestra ( Recorder Orchestra of Oregon ) and host an annual music workshop ( Columbia Gorge Early Music Retreat ). Our organization brings “recorder appreciation” to all! Join our Playing Sessions! The Portland Recorder Society gathers for large ensemble playing sessions September through May. Jacob Breedlove leads and drums the rhythm for a 4-part early music piece. Sessions are held on SUNDAYS in the early afternoon, depending on holidays and scheduling of the annual Columbia Gorge Early Music Retreat. Each session is led by a professional musician with music provided. All playing levels are welcomed and all sizes of recorders from contrabass to sopranino are needed. Other “recorder-friendly” instruments such as viola da gambas and soft reeds are welcomed. TaborSpace at 5441 SE Belmont Please bring instruments, pencil, and a music stand. Sessions are held at TaborSpace, inside the Mt.Tabor Presbyterian Church at 5441 SE Belmont St. Portland, Oregon. Parking at the Tabor Space is easy! Use their lot with the entrance on 54th Ave. You may enter the building on the walkway directly across from the parking lot entrance.
