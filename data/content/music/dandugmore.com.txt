Gibson Southern Jumbo 1949 / Gibson LG2 1949 Fender 1000 1957 I like Vintage Accoustic Guitars better because the wood they used back then was aged longer. The Luthiers, which are Guitar Makers, took more time building each guitar, so the craftmanship is outstanding. When Guitars are played it breaks down the the interior wood fibers and the tone improves. The Tone is magnified when you record it so you get really great sounding records. Vintage Electric Guitars had a Nitro Cellulose finish, which actually allowed the wood in the guitar to breath. But now because of the Ozone Dangers the guitar manufacturers are no longer able to use that finish. The old Pickups were hand wound. The present day pickups are wound on machines so here again you get a different tone quality. You are the counter Friend to stop in! Come back again!
