I am honored to be in this occupation, and I believe that my enthusiasm is evident in every instrument I build. My instruments are widely known for great sound, excellent playability, and the highest attention to detail. I also pride myself on my customer service. Many of my orders are from repeat customers, which I believe is an indicator of the quality of their experience working with me. My work has been featured in Mandolin Magazine, Mel Bay's Mandolin Sessions, Middlebury Magazine, JazzMando.com , Minnesota Bluegrass Magazine , Fretboard Journal's Bench Press column , 1859 Magazine , and the Bend Bulletin Newspaper . I've written articles for American Lutherie and Make Magazine . Please contact me with inquiries about custom orders and the length of my waiting list. These shops also sometimes have my instruments for sale: Carter Vintage , Greg Boyd's House of Fine Instruments , Carmel Music , MandoMutt.Com , and The Acoustic Music Company (in the UK). To see work in progress, please visit my Facebook page. I am also an authorized service center for Taylor guitars. home    |   contact    |   details and pricing    |   gallery    |     testimonials    |   workshop    |   about me    |    downloads    |   listen   You need JavaScript to see my email address (this is to prevent spam) Last Updated 11/5/18 © Andrew Mowry 2003 - 2018 unless otherwise noted. jQuery FlexSlider Syntax Highlighter Optional FlexSlider Additions
