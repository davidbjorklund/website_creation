The rich heritage, the luxury and the stories all come to life as you meander through a mansion that has been meticulously restored to its original splendour. When you enter Spruceholme You are immediately transported to another time and place. In every room you will find pieces of the past, and of George Brysonâs legacy. Look for his roll top desk and an autographed photo of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, a frequent visitor to his fellow statesman's home in Pontiac back in Fort-Coulonge's heyday. No matter which room you choose to stay in, you will find Bryson family heirlooms, exquisite comfort and peace. We invite you to share this living museum with us, any time of year.
