It stands as an old Kefalonian mansion overlooking the charming Kefalonia-Ithaca Sea Canal in the most idyllic spot of the Ionian Sea. As soon as you walk inside you will experience accommodation set in a stylish and romantic atmosphere combined with the generous, warm hospitality offered by Myra Sarris and her family. Start your day with Myra’s homemade Greek breakfast whilst enjoying the stone veranda filled with flowers and herbs. But don’t relax for too long, Kefalonia awaits you! Agnantia’s special island guide will show you the way for all the must see, do and savor. Early in the evening, after leaving behind the sun and sea until tomorrow return to the peaceful setting of Agnantia and your cozy apartment. Relax on your balcony with a glass of wine and enjoy the most enchanting sea views while listening to our hand-picked music selections. The island of Ithaca, the coastal cypress forest and its secluded bays, the small and pristine Daskalio Island and the passing yachts, all the beauty of the Ionian Sea unfolds before your eyes. After the sunset, enjoy the star-studded night sky and the full moon, a bright silver that illumines the sea.
