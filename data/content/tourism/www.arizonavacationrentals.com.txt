Chad Dockter February 2014 - Glendale, AZ I've never written a review for a vacation home before but the Arizona Vacation Rentals company surpassed my expectations and I felt compelled to share my experience. Communication was always great if I ever needed anything and If I ever had any questions. The process of renting the location was a simple and seamless. the information binder inside the home had all the information I could have possibly needed and was helpful. The home itself was fully furnished and felt welcoming. I instantly felt comfortable and everything was stocked from kitchen ware to towels and sheets. The maintenance on the location was top notch! Its obvious they have regular house cleaning done and the pool out back was maintained and clean. I enjoyed that the location was close to a main road and conveniently close to grocery stores, banks, etc... Overall a 100% wonderful experience and I highly recommend working with Arizona Vacation rentals whenever you are looking for a home rental. Schwab Group August 2017 - Aurora, IL Awesome home with great views and great covered patio perfect for entertaining family and friends. What a value over staying at a hotel. So much room and privacy! Samantha Gonzalez December 2013 - Lincolnwood, IL I was referred to this company by a friend and I see why! I had such an exceptional experience with this company from booking the house over the phone with Joanna to the follow up after the stay convo I had over the phone with Ron Jordon. The website itself is very detailed and includes everything you need to know about the homes you are browsing. There is a place for everyone on their website. When you book the home they send you emails with directions to the home and everything else you may need to know. Everything is VERY detailed. Also they give you a list of phone numbers for the check in/out line, maintenance, and many others just in case you need to contact someone if there ever is a problem. The home I did stay at needed something fixed so I called maintenance (on their day off) and they called me back within 10 minutes to schedule a repair for the next day. This company is extremely helpful and has the friendliest people working for them. I will be traveling to Arizona every other month for week periods and I will definitely book through this company. There is no point booking with hotels when you can book a vacation rental and feel at home. Thank you for the wonderful experience!!!! Henry Michan August 2012 - San Diego, CA Stayed at place called City Lights. Really had a nice time and highly recommend it for anyone looking for super special get away. Phoenix weather in February was 82! We were totally impressed - can hardly wait to return. Morning coffee on the patio overlooking the city and mountain is relaxing and memorable beyond description. Central location is ideal as well. Pictures of the property sold us but actually dont even do the place total justice. Its just awesome and some can hardly wait to go back. Scott Silverthorn September 2015 - St. Clair Shores, MI The house was very nice and met our needs. All that was described was present. The house was clean and in very good working order. I would absolutely use this service again.
