Another Padre's Inn - A Natchez Bed and Breakfast Welcome to "Another Padre's Inn" The accommodations themselves are separate from the main house for extra privacy.  Our comfortable bed and breakfast sits on a quiet acre that's only a few blocks from downtown Natchez! That means you're close to business, shopping, restaurants, and antiques.  In fact, a mere 7 block stroll will take you all the way to the bluff overlooking the Mississippi River.   Comfortable Accommodations From the luxurious bath to the satellite TV, Another Padre's Inn puts comfort at your fingertips.  Complimentary wine, juices, bottled water, and soft drinks welcome you to our hospitable bed and breakfast.  Sleep soundly in your antique queen size bed.  Continental Breakfast is served each morning, which you may enjoy on your own private balcony overlooking the swimming pool.  Then spend the day shopping, visiting the historic sites of Natchez, taking care of business, or lounging by the pool as the wind whispers through the Spanish Moss and our 100 year-old Cedar trees.   Convenient Location We've mentioned that Another Padre's Inn is just a couple of blocks from downtown, but we're also very close to other bed and breakfasts. So if you're coming with friends you could be just across the yard from them! Come relax with us.  Take a few days off and visit Another Padre's Inn .     Rates and Amenities Winter Special! - $89/night December - February (Holidays Excluded) Private Bedroom Luxurious Bath Private Balcony Wi-Fi Satellite TV Continental Breakfast Complimentary Wine, Juices, and Soft Drinks Two Blocks from Downtown Natchez Off-Street Parking Rate: $110/night (except in winter!)   Another Padre's Inn 19 Homochitto St. Natchez, MS  39120 601-807-3617 601-807-3256     Move your cursor over the photo below to get close-ups of the room       NatchezMS.com Travel & Tourism Guide to Natchez, MS
