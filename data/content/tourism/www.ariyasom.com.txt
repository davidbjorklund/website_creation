Next to BUMRUNGRAD hospital and SUKHUMVIT Road. Welcome to AriyasomVilla Small luxury Boutique Hotel and Spa in the heart of Bangkok, superbly located just off Sukhumvit Road and near to Bumrungrad Hospital. Sawadee Krap and welcome to AriyasomVilla! AriyasomVilla first opened it's doors to guests in August 2008. The original Villa was built by Khun Pariyas' Grandfather and Grandmother in 1941/2.   When first built, the villa was considered to be in the outskirts of the City but over the last 70+ years the City has pushed out to the east and we are now in the very centre of town. When we built the hotel our intentions were to build something with an authentic "Thai" feeling - I hope we've succeeded. AriyasomVilla is a small luxury boutique hotel with just 24 guestrooms, restaurant (Na Aroon), Thai Spa (som Sen), small function room and meditation hall.   We have 4 categories of room - Studio, Deluxe, Executive Deluxe and Suites - please let us know your requirements - see " Rooms and Rates " for more details. As AriyasomVilla is a small hotel we often get booked up, however, it's always a good idea to check direct with the hotel on info(at)ariyasom.com or call +6622548880 Our Na Aroon restaurant serves vegetarian and seafood - we don't serve meat. This may seem strange to some but please do try our fresh, tasty, zesty and healthy Thai Cuisine - I'm sure you'll enjoy it and appreciate the difference - for more detail see " Na Aroon ". For a booking at the restaurant please contact us on info(at)ariyasom.com or call +6622548880       Head up the river to Wat Arun (Temple of Down), Wat Poh (the Reclining Buddha). Not far from these major attractions is the flower maket (Bak Klong Talad). Bangkok is a major shopping destination and we're not far from the very hub of it - Siam Paragon, Central World, Emporium and of course Chatujak weeken market. Even after liveing here for 23 years I Still visit the market on a regular basis.   AriyasomVilla is located almost next door to the No. 1 hospital in South East Asia - Bumringrad international. It's agreat facility to have in the vicinity and a number of guests take advantage of our proximity. By no means cheap, Bumrungrad, provides first class medical for an extensive array of ailments and conditions - check out their website - www.bumrungrad.com.   There's seldom a dull moment living in Bangkok but I do want to reiterate about the usual scams! The main temples and sites are very seldom closed - please  don't fall for the scammers telling you that they are closed and that you should jump into a tun tuk and go and buy jewelry, tailoring, travel and accommodation, etc etc. The application of just a modicum of common sense will save upset, disappointment and money!   We look forward to welcoming to AriysomVilla Best regards David & Khun Pariya Online Booking Online booking Hotel identifier Check-in Check-in Date 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 January February March April May June July August September October November December 2019 2020 Nights Number of nights 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 Promo Code Promo Code Cancel a booking Availability In the event that your dates are not available please do contact us on rsvn(at)ariyasom.com to double check.
