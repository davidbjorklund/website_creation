HOME LODGE & CABINS CAMPGROUND DAY USE/OHT PARKING TRAILS/ACTIVITIES WEDDINGS FAQ CONTACT More The Lodge Cabins Campground   Experience nature and adventure at historic White Rock Mountain...   This Ozark National Forest Recreation Area features three unique and rustic natural stone cabins  and a large natural stone    lodge   all built in the 1930’s by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC).  Each features a stone  fireplace,  original wood furniture handcrafted by the CCC, and stunning stone patios overlooking the Ozark National Forest.   White Rock Mountain is 2,309 feet above sea level and received its name from the appearance of the lichen on the sheer bluffs that appear white from a distance.  Guests at White Rock can enjoy incredible scenic views from the lodge, cabins, campground, and surrounding bluffs. ​ Wind, rain and natural elements had caused the deterioration of the buildings over the years.  In 1987 a volunteer group, Friends of White Rock, began a project to renovate the historic structures. With a lot of commitment and hard work, the lodge and cabins were restored by 1991. ​ In January of 2017, new  concessionaires and hosts moved to the facility and have begun further  rejuvenation  of White Rock. In addition to adding new furnishings/decor in the Lodge/Cabins, the team has been restoring the electrical,  plumbing, and water filtration system. Projects also include repairing the original CCC  furniture ,  renovating  the host house and general store, improving the campground facilities, and reclaiming the day use areas. ​ White Rock Mountain also offers 9 primitive family campsites . These easily accessible shaded campsites include tents pads, fire rings, grills, picnic tables, two water sources, parking at each site, and  clean  vault toilets. Small RV's or pop-up campers can be accommodated at a few sites. The campground is also undergoing  rejuvenation. Completed projects include new gravel in the tent pads/picnic areas and reclaimed lawns.  ​ White Rock Mountain is the hub of several National Forest hiking trail systems including the 2 mile loop trail around the rim of mountaintop, the 17 mile Shores Lake loop trail, and the renowned  Ozark Highlands Trail .  Other recreational activities include Shores Lake Recreation Area , National Scenic Mulberry River , National Forest ATV trails , fishing, hunting, and more. ​ Please visit the new Facebook page  White Rock Mountain Recreation Area for road updates,  weather,  and project progress!
