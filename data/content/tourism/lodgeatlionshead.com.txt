Reviews Jen and Craig at the front desk are exceptional! They understand ‘hospitality’ and treated us like VIP guests. So glad we chose Lodge at Lionshead. We had a wonderful weekend and will be back! Sara, Philadelphia, PA No other property puts the entire vacation experience together as well as Lodge at Lionshead. The condominiums are great and location is nearly perfect, but the best thing is the excellent service by the caring people at the front desk. I always feel right at home there. It’s my favorite place to stay in Vail. Hap, Dallas, TX   1 of 3 next › Specials Best Available Rate The lowest rate available for select dates throughout the season.
