The Island lies in the eastern part of the Ionian Sea, around 20 km west of the Greek mainland and 15 km south of Cephalonia. Named after Zakynthos, the son of a legendary Arcadian chief Dardanus, the island’s multicultural history goes back in ancient era as Homer describes its dense forests in Odyssey. Throughout time many civilizations ruled it from the ancient Greeks and Romans to the Byzantines, Venetians, Russians, French and English. Zakynthos’ nickname “Fiore di Levante” (flower of the East) is attributed to the Venetians whose cultural influence was considerable.In 1864 the island was united with Greece.
