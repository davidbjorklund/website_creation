The price was reasonable. Our room was behind the office/kitchen area, so we didn’t have a very nice view and we had a bit of noise from the kitchen (pans clanging, etc). We didn’t <a href="/reviews">Read More</a> "Clean Good Value" 4 of 5 stars Reviewed 16 August 2012 This is good value for money the rooms are a great size with a mini bar , toaster, kettle, microwave, all the things to make your own breakfast or dinner if you want to. Needs updating but its worth the stay compared to some other motels close by.Very clean and lots of room to move around,.Would stay again. <a href="/reviews">Read More</a> "A great place to stay and eat in Bundaberg" 5 of 5 stars Reviewed 28 September 2012 The Park Lane Motel is now called Econolodge but Greg and Elly are still the Owner/Managers. Greg cooks up a storm in the kitchen, the food is first rate. The motel is also about to undergo a remodelling and they have received quite a few awards for service,comfort and excellence.

It’s close to town and has a restaurant on site which has good food. The air conditioner is in the bathroom for some reason which is odd….I will prob stay here again when I just need somewhere to sleep. <a href="/reviews">Read More</a> "Great family hotel" 4 of 5 stars Reviewed 1 week ago With units that can accommodate 2 Adults and 3 children this is the best in Bundaberg. Clean and close to town. Dinner was very tasty but rather small serves for the cost. Air conditioner worked well as it was a rather cold night. <a href="/reviews">Read More</a> "Best Motel in Bundaberg" 5 of 5 stars Reviewed 30 September 2013 We have stayed with Greg and Eli at this Motel many times. We have found their hospitality to be the best and the Restaurant serves the best of food. The rooms are well appointed (having tried nearly all of their rooms) and spotlessly clean. We would not hesitate to recommend this Motel to travellers. <a href="/reviews">Read More</a> <iframe src="https://www.google.com/maps/embed?pb=!1m14!1m8!1m3!1d28958.189385619262!2d152.3814910857979!3d-24.871578423817663!3m2!1i1024!2i768!4f13.1!3m3!1m2!1s0x6bebb946e31b510d%3A0x7949a008ea03b0e1!2s247+Bourbong+St%2C+Bundaberg+West+QLD+4670%2C+Australia!5e0!3m2!1sen!2sin!4v1407216150395" width="800" height="325" frameborder="0" style="border:0"></iframe> 247 Bourbong St Bundaberg West QLD 4670 Australia Our Facilities Award-winning licensed restaurant & lounge Function room with full catering available Undercover parking Free wireless broadband available Direct dial phone and fax facilities Saltwater pool & spa Undercover barbecue area Park & playground adjacent Laundry and dry cleaning service available Breakfast and dinner served to your unit Bus & coach parking Tour desk Public transportation nearby & much more Award-Winning Dining Award-Winning Dining Park Lane Licensed Restaurant Award-winning dining and lounge in the heart of Be sure to check out the recently renovated Park Lane Restaurant.
