The boat ride was so relaxing. We were able to see over 30 species of birds, crocodile and cayman and both howler and capuchino monkeys in action! We left the tour with a greater appreciation for the diversity of this land and the people. Harald, Jeanette and Luca.     11 Noviembre Hoje abaixo de chuva fomos fazer a tiroleza. Estavamos com receio por causa do mal tempo mas nos armamos de coragem e fomos para aventura. Foi muito bom, imagino como seria com tempo bom. Recomendo com qualquer tempo.
