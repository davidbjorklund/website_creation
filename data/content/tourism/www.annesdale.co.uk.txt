Annesdale House - Home Home Bedrooms House & Gardens Breakfast Tariff & Special Offers Enquiries Activities Location Although you may have found us under B&B accommodation we hope you will agree that we are far from a typical or a Boutique B&B establishment. Our house is not a business but our home which we have been lovingly restoring little by little over the last 23 years. Since our children left the nest we have decided to occasionally let our two luxurious guest suites when we are not otherwise occupied. A maximum of four guests at any one time allows us the opportunity to respond to your individual needs, whilst maintaining a relaxed and friendly atmosphere. We have spent most of our working lives running hotels and owned restaurants in the Lake District, and enjoy being able to look after our guests to the highest standards. Our aim is that guests feel as if staying with friends. At Annesdale we are not looking for any awards, ratings or stars, and instead strive to make your stay in the Lake District as enjoyable, relaxing and memorable as possible. One important feature of Annesdale House is its location. Blissfully quiet, set in large mature gardens and yet all facilities are within a short walking distance, including buses and trains, the local Tourist Information Centre, shops, restaurants and you don't need to use a car.
