We stayed at the house for 2 weeks in August with our 2 children. It's a really lovely house, with everything you could need for an excellent holiday. There is a very nice pool area & the decor throughout is to a very high standard. It is located perfectly for trips to the port of Fiskardo (just less than 10 mins by car) and for North Kefalonia. We highly recommend both the house & the island. A special mention also about Georgia & her parents & their amazing hospitality. Nothing was too much trouble, as they consistently went out out of their way to make us feel very welcome. They made the holiday a very special one for the whole family. We hope to return to the house and the island again very soon! Recommended for: Age 55+, Sightseeing, Families with Teenagers, Families with Young Children, Romantic Getaway. Steve S. Nemus Little piece of heaven on earth.. We had the vacation of our life at Nemus Villa.(and we are very fussy).The decor was beautiful with great attention to detail and with everything you could possibly need, and just as amazing was the outside space, we literally had to drag ourselves away on some days as we could have quite simply spent all day around the stunning pool gazing at the breathtaking views. The welcome from Nick and Claire (the owners), is something that we have never had before. And a special thank you to Georgia who was extremly helpful! And you should definetely try Nick's organic fruit&vegetables..we have never tasted something like that before! We can not wait to be back!. Michael A. John Doe Gaia Absolutely Perfect! We booked this villa as we needed a relaxing, private getaway, with glorious sunshine, beautiful places to visit in a luxurious surrounding, and that's certainly what we got! We were met at the airport by Georgia's lovely parents Nick and Clara, who helped us find the villa, which was approximately 1 hours drive around the picturesque coastal roads - which was lovely as we got to see the sights right from the start. We had an unforgettable 12 days in Kefalonia. The villa was perfectly situated, with local shops (to get snacks and cold drinks - much needed as it did get very hot at times!) and a short drive to many local beaches and the port of Fiskardo. We enjoyed beautiful weather, experiencing temperatures up to about 35 degrees C. Sunbathing at the villa was a joy. The pool was amazing! A very good size and so refreshing to jump into when the heat gets a little too much! We also enjoyed the sea breeze that would come up the hills from the sea, without this I think it would have got a little too hot! (Not that thats a bad thing!) The villa was beautifully equipped with tea and coffee making facilities, beautiful kitchen, luxurious bathrooms and superior bedrooms with comfy beds! We enjoyed watching the occasional movie in the evening with the doors open looking at the beautiful sunsets. The stars would all be out at night too, and sitting outside with a glass of wine watching the world go by was absolute perfection. We think one of the best things about this villa is the organically grown fruit and vegetables grown by Nick! We would get a generous supply of fruit and vegetables everyday that was absolutely gorgeous! We got addicted to the big, juicy tomatoes and would have Greek salads pretty much everyday - perfect for a nice quick lunch. We explored the island in the car and enjoyed a few trips to the port of Fiskardo. There were plenty of restaurants and bars to go to, and we enjoyed watching the yachts and boats come into port whilst having a glass of wine. Local beaches were stunning, and swimming in the waters was such a joy! Crystal clear waters, picture perfect scenery and all day sunshine - what more could you ask for! To sum up - an absolutely glorious holiday! We will definitely be returning. Georgia and her family have created the perfect getaway, so don't hesitate to book your holiday here! You will not be disappointed. Recommended for: Age 55+, Girls Getaway, Sightseeing, Families with Teenagers, Families with Young Children, Romantic Getaway. Robin A. Nemus PERFECT! This villa is just as beautiful as it looks in the photos, indeed the minute you open the gate and see it your cares just melt away. When you open your shutters in the morning you have an unobstructed vista of the sparkling sea and, with a perfect view of the magnificent sunset from almost anywhere you are - pool, house, garden - and a very well equipped kitchen to rustle up a sundowner, the day is perfect from beginning to end. Claire and Nick, who manage the property, are lovely people and very generous with the produce from their organic garden; they often popped in with an exquisite Greek dish Claire had cooked for us to enjoy â which we certainly did! Georgia is very helpful and makes the booking process simple and efficient. The kind and generous spirit of this family is reflected in the care given to both the villa and guests. When you add all this to the lovely bathroom, comfortable bed and gorgeous garden set in an exquisite environment, what more could you ask for? You really do have everything here â beautiful accommodation, tranquil setting, traditional village within walking distance, tavernas on the beach a short drive away and Fiscardo nearby. I highly recommend a stay here. Elaine F. Gaia Paradise on Earth.. Our family of four stayed at Villa Gaia for two weeks in July 2014. The house is beautifully designed and decorated with a large living space and comfortable bedrooms and equipped with everything you need. The garden and pool (salt water not chlorine) are very well laid out with table and chairs, hammock and sunbeds. You can see the sea and are perfectly positioned to watch the sunset. We always found there was plenty of shade, either from the large umbrella or trees. The villa is situated within walking distance of a mini-market, fruit and vegetable shop and a couple of restaurants. You really need a car to get to the nearby beaches but they are only a few miles away. There is also a marked circular walk of 14km which is lovely to do that will take in some of the bays and Fiskardo. There are plenty of places to visit for days out and the nearby harbour town, Fiskardo, is very pretty with nice shops and restaurants. We found it a really relaxing holiday. Although the tourist season was well underway we found the roads quiet, never had any problems parking and could always get a table in the restaurants. Throughout Georgia was always very helpful and friendly and responded to any questions we had very quickly. Georgia's parents, Nic and Claire, who lived next door were lovely and their hospitality was second to none. Nic brought round vegetables from his organic garden frequently. These included huge tomatoes, courgettes, cucumbers, aubergines and lettuce and they were delicious. Nic even cooked us a couple of wonderful meals. This hospitality, together with the local knowledge they shared, made this a special holiday to remember and recommend. Gill H. Nemus Exceptional villa!!! The villa was of very high quality and Nicos and Claire (owners) are too good to be true!Nothing was too much trouble for them, they showed us where the best local "off the beaten track" coves were for swimming and supplied us with lovely fresh fruit and vegetables from their garden.The location is perfect for a quiet getaway but only a short walk to restaurants and the local shops. Our first villa rental and one that's going to be hard to beat!. Alessandra B. Gaia One of the Best Villas! We visited Kefalonia, never having been to Greece before. The island is idyllic, surrounded by a turquoise , crystal clear sea. We found wonderful little bays and breathtaking views as we drove around the island. We enjoyed many trips to Fiskardo which has a wide range of shops and excellent restaurants. We particularly enjoyed having coffee in the morning, watching the sailing boats anchoring in the harbour, and ferrying people onto the quayside. The Villa Gaia has been renovated to a high standard and has everything we needed to make our stay extremely comfortable. Nick and Clare are excellent hosts and went out of their way to make sure our stay was successful. They were kind and generous and were able to give us an insight into real life in Greece. They made us Greek breakfasts and supplied us with fresh produce from Nick's organic garden. We really enjoyed meeting them. It was very helpful to have them giving us information about where to visit, where best to eat etc., and to tell you of any special events that were taking place. We spent three very happy weeks here and were sad to leave. After a few weeks at home we decided to return next year, for four weeks this time! Marian and Alan R.
