Granary from tail race bridge Being so close to the sea, the Granary is ideally located for hiking, surfing, coasteering, pony trekking, climbing and many other activities that the area has to offer. Due to the influence of the north Atlantic, Pembrokeshire enjoys a relatively mild climate. Even in the coldest months of winter, temperatures rarely dip more than a couple of degrees below zero. Historically, Pembrokeshire has also been one of the most sunny places in the UK. But just in case you should hit a cool spell, the Granary self-catering holiday cottage is fitted with under-floor heating throughout and, for that cosy feel, a wood-burning stove. For today’s local weather see BBC Weather . Immediately outside the front door is a seat and picnic table overlooking the water wheel and beautiful Roch Mill gardens. These are enhanced by the lower mill-race which meanders through them. The gardens encompas two large ponds and are bounded by the Brandybrook river. We have all manner of wildlife here at the Mill, both resident and passing through our six-acre patch. Occasionally we have an otter swimming in the pond and once caught a fleeting glimpse of an otter pup. We think that “mum” was raising a brood under our upturned boat, but the onset of grass cutting was just too noisy for her. We also have a resident kingfisher who until recently has been hard to spot, but since we erected a perch in the main pond he’s been a frequent visitor. Roch Mill is a paradise for naturalists. We have at least two kinds of bats and a pair of tawny owls that breed here every year. The ponds are abundant with frogs, toads, countless dragonflies, damselflies and the beautiful demoiselle. There are brown trout and eels in the pond and we have a pair of resident moorhens.
