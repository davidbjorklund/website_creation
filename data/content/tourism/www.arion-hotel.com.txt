The hotel is named after Arion, the famous poet and composer who lived in Samos from 625 to 585 BC. Mythology relates that once while he was travelling by sea, pirates stormed the boat and threatened to kill him. Arion requested that he be allowed to sing one last song. The wish granted, he sang with such feeling that a flock of dolphins gathered round the boat and when he was thrown overboard, one of them carried him on its back safely to the shore.
