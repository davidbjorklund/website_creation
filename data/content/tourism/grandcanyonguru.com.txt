Today white water rafters traverse the Grand Canyons 277 miles down the Colorado River , which is also used to measure the length of the Canyon. The Grand Canyon is neither the widest nor the deepest canyon in the world, but it is certainly the most spectacular because it exposes myriad rock formations seen nowhere else in the world, some dating back 2 billion years - close to the age of the world's oldest rocks! The formation of Grand Canyon National Park came much, much later, in 1919. At the South Rim , the depth of the Canyon is 1 mile, while the elevation at the North Rim is about1,000 ft. higher. As the crow flies, the length from rim to rim ranges from between ten and eighteen miles. Trail miles are much longer, posing an exciting challenge for the most committed of Canyon hikers.  Starting at Lee's Ferry below Lake Powell, Grand Canyon National Park encompasses a whopping 1.2 million acres, ending at Grand Wash Cliffs near Lake Mead. Parts of the Canyon are also found on Native American Reservation land. Grand Canyon Destinations Planning a trip to the Grand Canyon?

Driving distances from nearby cities are: Las Vegas: 5 hours, Phoenix: 4 hours, Flagstaff, AZ: 1 1/2 hours, and Williams, AZ: 1 hour. It will take you 3 hours to drive from the South Rim to the North Rim, and 6 hours if you are coming from Phoenix. From Las Vegas, it's a 5 hour drive, and you can hit up Zion National Park on the way. Found within the Havasupai Indian Reservation, Havasu Falls is a popular place to check out when visiting the Canyon. Driving times to the Hualapai Hilltop Trailhead are: Las Vegas: 4 hours, Phoenix: 5 hours, South Rim: 3 hours. Lodging accommodations can be found within the park, and in Tusuyan, the closest town to the entrance of the South Rim. There is also some lodging available in Seligman, AZ, the closest town to the Havasu Falls trailhead, and at the North Rim of the Canyon. Save for acts of nature, The South Rim is open all day, every day, while the North Rim is closed from mid October to mid May due to snow. The entrance fee is $25 per vehicle. Extra fees apply for camping and backpacking . Grand Canyon Weather Spring and fall are the best times of year to visit the Canyon, when you will most likely find mild daytime temperatures and clear skies. Although it's often the only time many families can make it out, summers in the Canyon are hot and dry, although monsoons will cool things off in the afternoons of July and August. A great way to escape the heat and crowds of the summer is to break away to the cool breezes of North Rim. A rafting trip on the chilly waters of the Colorado is another great activity when temps reach the low 100's. This is also a great time to hike down to Havasu Falls, where you will be rewarded for your journey with stunning blue green waterfalls. Winters are slower at the Canyon, when many people do not expect to see snow, but it gets quite cold at 7,000 ft!
