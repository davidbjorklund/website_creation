I’m installing new front windows in Cabin 3, and this is what I am forced to look at every, single, day. Be thankful that you too, are NOT here having to endure this. You get to look at crowds, and cars, and buildings. All I get to look at is nothing. No noise, no distractions, no robberies, no murders, no great WIFI….just this lake and those pesky loons calling in the background. It’s tough to take. If you would like to spend your time being miserable – ya poor lug – give us a call at 218-365-5489 Ugh – this is what June looks like at Northwind Lodge near Ely, MN. .entry-content #post-## Ely’s ONLY Art Resort On June 13, 2019 June 13, 2019 By Red Rock In art program , Fernberg Gallery Leave a comment .entry-header We have art AND good fishing in the wilderness!  Offering beautiful works of art by Joe Baltich and other local artists, Northwind Lodge is by far one of the most unique vacation experiences in northeast Minnesota!

Learn how to fish our region and experience wilderness fishing at its finest with a veteran guide. Wood Lake Guided Trips 1.) $290  per day with Bernie.   Bait and tackle included –  2 person limit 2.) $250 per day with Dan.   Bait and tackle is included – 2 person limit Groups of four will need to hire both guides for the same day or go on two different day trips with one guide as the rowing can be difficult for some people to keep up with the guide boat particularly if rough weather develops. Your guide will maneuver a rowing boat or canoe on Wood lake which is a Boundary Waters Canoe Area  wilderness lake.  There are no homes or structures of any kind in the BWCA.  This trip will  requires a walk in on a portage.  Please Pack your own lunch and remember that  no metal cans or glass bottles are allowed.  Plastic bottles and containers are allowed but, of course, must be packed out as well.  Duluth packs are available for people to help carry their day gear in the event that they do not have a day pack.   PFD’s also provided as no extra charge.    Fall Lake Only –  4 Hour,  half-day trip $200 for 2 people and $20 for each extra person up to 4 total.   Bait and tackle is provided and you may bring your own tackle to try as well. Pack your own lunch.  No cans or bottles as this trip can cross into the BWCA. Basswood – All Day You must have a BWCA day-use motor permit.  If you do not have a permit, the guide can attempt to find a permit tag (it’s confusing and difficult government mumbo-jumbo) to see if a Basswood trip is possible during the time you are here.  Otherwise, for long-term reservations, please secure a day-use motor permit to Basswood in advance at  recreation.gov  (click link).  Sorry, you must make a reservation in your own name.  We cannot do that service for you. Day-use motor permits are severely limited and hard to obtain. $350 for 2 people and extra $25 each extra person up to 4 total.   Bait and tackle is provided and you may also bring your own to try. This trip is in the BWCA.   Pack your own lunch and remember that  no metal cans or glass bottles are allowed.  Plastic bottles are OK, but must be packed out. What To Bring For all guided trips you are required to bring your own fishing rods and reels, rain gear and appropriate clothing for the temperatures at that time.  Flip flops are never recommended and Crocs are not suitable footwear for portaging.  Preferably, closed toe footwear is recommended such as a running shoe or hiking boot.  We also recommend full length pants over shorts as sometimes there can be insects.  It makes for a more comfortable adventure. Walleye fillets in the field!  They don’t get any fresher than this!  Book ahead however!  Excellent guides are hard to find! Reserving a Trip Advance reservations are always welcomed due to planning, scheduling, preparation requirements and weather accommodations.  Please reserve your trip as early as possible.  Last minute trips are possible but can be hit-or-miss do to guide commitments.  We will do our best to get you on the water for a great day out out on the water. Payment in full at the time of the trip reservation is required – Sorry, there are no refunds for trip cancellations.   Call 218-365-5489 to make your guided trip reservation. .entry-content #post-## ﻿Nurture Yourself in Nature with Sudha, August 2019 On April 3, 2019 By Red Rock In art program , Rental Cabins , Short Stay Cabin Rentals , Things to Do Leave a comment .entry-header Nurture Yourself in Nature with Sudha, August 2019 “Feel new again in Ely, Minnesota’s outdoor recreation paradise Vacations are about jumping out of what’s normal and into an adventure that makes us feel new again — and that’s what brings people back to Ely, Minnesota, year after year.
