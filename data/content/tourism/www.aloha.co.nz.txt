Reviews Stayed there for 1 week in December and had the best time. Rooms are big and spacious, and the beds are really comfortable. Rohit the new owner was extremely friendly and took time to talk to us. Lots for the kids to do and has a wonderful view Jacoba Bright - Google Fabulous place to stay. Amenities are well maintained. A place to keep the kids and adults occupied with spa, swimming pool, playground, trampoline and a games room. You can even take the boat and your dog. The setting and views allowed us to unwind and relax. Not too far away from the main street in Paihia. Management were extremely helpful and friendly. Would highly recommend. Rochelle T - Trip Advisor Nice staff to deal with, very helpful and pleasant. Resort has a sweet pool and spa. Kids enjoyed both. Games room was basic but kept my kids entertained. Clean tidy room. Spacious rooms and comfortable stay for family of 6. Basic TV channels, and TV reception. Shower was weak but spacious bathroom, separate toilet. No frills kitchen but clean. Happy to recommend Aloha Seaview Resort Mel N - Trip Advisor Staff were friendly and very accommodating. Location was close to town and all facilities were child friendly and appropriate. A+ well recommended and I will definitely be back Jahnita Rose - Booking.com Great facilities, we particularly enjoyed the BBQ and table tennis table. Rooms were lovely and clean and we particularly enjoyed how friendly the cleaner who made up the sofa bed for us was :) great views and a very relaxing stay.
