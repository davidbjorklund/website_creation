We are originally from Switzerland and England and speak German and French fluently but very happy to now call NZ and the Bay of Islands home. We welcome guests to share our home for a while and we will happily share our knowledge of the Bay of Islands and the rest of New Zealand to help you have the very best stay and take away happy memories. We hope guests will use Allegra House as a home for a few days while visiting Waitangi (birthplace of NZ) and other historic places, sail or cruise among the islands, go fishing, swim with dolphins, enjoy a day trip to kauri forest or Cape Reinga, or relax on one of the many beaches around the Bay (see 'Things to do' page for suggestions). We can help you with your tour bookings either once you arrive or have tickets ready for you on arrival. There is so much to do in the area we can fill as many days as you have and hope you may even find time to relax and enjoy the views. /col-md-7 /col-md-5 /row /wrap-in /wrap-hosts /col-md-12 /row A perfect start to our first trip to New Zealand!

The breakfast was healthy and tasty. The hosts speak German, French and English. They have good advice for day trips. Birgit S. , Rotorua, NZ. /testimonial /col-sm-12 /row /item So wish we could have stayed longer than one night. The hospitality was amazing. The view spectacular. The bed so comfortable we slept in for the first time on our holiday. Staying at the top of the hill was so worthwhile. The recommendations we were given for restaurants and attractions were spot on. A beautiful find in a beautiful spot.
