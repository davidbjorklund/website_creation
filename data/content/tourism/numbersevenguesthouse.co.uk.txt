Whitby Abbey ruins dominate the headland, next to St Mary’s Church and graveyard, which inspired the story of Dracula, making a dramatic landscape. Whitby centre has cobbled streets, quirky shops, ample trendy bars and fantastic restaurants. It is also famous for superb fresh fish and chips. The beautiful blue flag beach, with its colourful beach huts, stretches towards Sandsend, which is located just a three mile stroll away. In the opposite direction along the Cinder Track or Cleveland Way Coastal path is Robin Hoods Bay, a beautiful oldie world fishing village depicted in a number of Hollywood films as the quintessential old English fishing hamlet.
