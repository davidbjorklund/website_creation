We came to celebrate our 50th anniversary and this place made it special. Erin, the host/owner, was so kind and helpful. The breakfasts were varied and delicious, served in three courses. There is a small coffee room with coffee/tea available all day and night. The rooms are not large but are roomy enough and nicely decorated. Our room had a large bathroom with two sinks which was a plus. We had a wonderful time here and would definitely stay again. Erin â We spent three nights in their Tuscan suite. This bed and breakfast may be the best one we have stayed in. The room was impeccably decorated with an eye for detail. The house was built in 1928 and is located conveniently a walking distance to downtown. The new owner Erin was very helpful with winery suggestions and places to eat. Her breakfast creations are to die for. Even though the weather was rainy, the place felt cozy and comfortable. We will be sure to return. Alerche â Beautiful home with comfortable accommodations and delicious breakfast. Innkeepers were friendly and charming. A perfect weekend getaway! Thank you!
