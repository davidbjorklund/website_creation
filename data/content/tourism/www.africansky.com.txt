Read Full article Why choose a safari or tour in Africa for your vacation? 1 Just Getting Away From It All For most travelers, the purpose of a vacation is to take a break from one's everyday life, to be stimulated by new surroundings, cultures, scenery and experiences - visiting distant lands that might and probably will offer new perspectives on that which occupies the mind. If this is your idea of a relaxing getaway, few places are more remote yet accessible, few offer a wider variety of cultures, vastly different geographical landscapes or more adventure activities to choose from than the countries of Southern Africa. 2 The Tranquility of Africa's Wild Places The African wilderness is magical in so many ways. Enjoying a sunrise over the vastness of Namibia's dune sea, viewing an elephant mother shielding her little one from the rest of the herd as they approach the banks of the Chobe River in northern Botswana, or listening to the sounds of night while enjoying a glass of wine around a crackling fire in South Africa's Kruger National Park are soul-enriching experiences that can only be enjoyed on a safari tour in Africa. 3 Be Spoilt for Choice You have a great variety of choices as far as lodgings are concerned, ranging from comfortable and affordable to luxurious and exclusive. As with the accommodations, the range of experiences and the locations in which these can be enjoyed are as diverse as the vibrant city of Cape Town and the endless sun-scorched expanse of the Etosha Pan in Namibia, as leisurely as relaxing on a tropical beach in Mozambique and as exhilarating as encountering lion's on a bush walk in the Sabi Sand. African Safari Adventures not to be missed The safari tour options below count amongst the most extraordinary travel experiences available today. From Botswana's wild water worlds to Namibia's vast, arid expanses, you'll enjoy bewitching landscapes, fine accommodations and, most importantly, unrivaled game viewing. South African Safaris South Africa boasts a plethora of national parks, private game reserves and wilderness concessions that can suit a range of budgets. Kruger Park Safaris The Kruger National Park is South Africa's premier safari tour area and the subcontinent's supreme Big Five safari destination. Safaris in Botswana The vast country of Botswana is still authentically wild, with near-virginal wilderness areas for safari experiences reminiscent of yesteryear. Safaris in Namibia Namibia's safari areas are breathtaking in their ability to support a generous stream of wildlife in a startlingly arid environment. Need Travel Advice?
