Hotel accommodation on Achill Island, Ireland A small lodging house here on our premises at Achill Sound, Achill Island, was the only hostelry providing accommodation for Achill Island and the Curraun Peninsula before 1839. Since then the premises have seen many changes including a licensed shop and hotel dating back to the late 1880s. ‘Sweeney’s Hotel’ at Achill Sound, Achill Island was run by Mrs Alice Sweeney, late grandmother of Michael McLoughlin, proprietor of Óstán Oileán Acla (Achill Island Hotel). Óstán Oileán Acla – Achill Island’s newest hotel Alice’s Harbour Bar, an extension of Sweeney’s Hotel, was demolished on Tuesday July 21st 1999 to make way for this new development – Óstán Oileán Acla (Achill Island Hotel). Our family run hotel combines first class accommodation and banqueting facilities with aspects of local culture and heritage from Achill Island and the surrounding area which we hope you will enjoy.
