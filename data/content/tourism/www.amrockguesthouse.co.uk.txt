Amrock Guest House is situated in the North Bay area of Scarborough. A full program of refurbishment has been undertaken since 2004. Our Guest House now offers a range of individual letting rooms, each aimed at individual users. All rooms have full en suite facilities, tea and coffee making facilities and colour TV with DVD capabilities. We also offer free WiFi access. For further details please see the  accommodation  area of this site. Amrock Guest House is strictly 100% non smoking. We regret that we are unable to take pets (guide dogs excepted). **** At our last inspection we were awarded AA 4* Guest House rating **** Our Edwardian guest house was built in 1906 and has three upper floors and a basement. The 8 front steps with handrails either side lead to the entrance porch, and entrance hall. On this floor is the Breakfast room and kitchen. 16 stairs with handrails either side will take you to our first floor with rooms 1, 2 and 3. A further 14 stairs, also with handrails either side, will take you to the top floor where our family suite , a single room and our recently completed double room are situated. As you can appreciate several small suitcases/bags are preferable to one large one. If you come by car our guests' have to park on the street for which we can provide you with a parking permit or disk. We cannot guarantee you a space but if you are arriving late please let us know and we will try to save you a space close by. There is a public car park a few minutes walk away. The links above should provide you with all the information you need about our guest house. However if you do have questions, just email your query or use the enquiry form .
