Welcome to My Mountain Cabin Rentals, gateway to the Blue Ridge Mountains in beautiful North Central Georgia Mountains. This area is popular among cabin rental vacationers, nature lovers, fishermen, and outdoor enthusiasts nationwide. It boasts beautiful Blue Ridge mountain ranges, scores of natural lakes and Georgia mountain streams, and a tranquil, country atmosphere. Visitors return year after year for outdoor recreational activities and quiet cabin getaways in North Georgia. The mountain town of Blue Ridge has a wide array of available lodging, hiking trails, excellent restaurants and shops, and a full schedule of folk music festivals, arts shows, and community events. The rich history and architecture of the North Georgia Mountains and Blue Ridge offers fascinating insights into our Nation’s past. The North Georgia Mountains were originally Cherokee country, and the remnants of that great civilization are in evidence all around. They considered this to be their “Enchanted Land.” Cherokees farmed the Blue Ridge Mountains during temperate seasons, and left the area during the winter for warmer climates. Early colonial settlers discovered the agricultural wealth offered by the North Georgia and Blue Ridge mountains, and they moved into the area to farm and harvest the forest. Unfortunately, the harvesting of the forest placed the environment at great risk, and in the early 1930’s the federal government bought the north Georgia mountain land and created the Chattahoochee National Forest to prevent further damage and to reforest the Blue Ridge mountain area. During the reforestation project, two camps were established in Fannin County, Georgia -- Camp Sea Creek and Camp Wilscot. Other camps were established in the surrounding north Georgia mountains which also contributed to the restoration. The Chattahoochee National Forest covers almost 750,000 acres and spans 18 Georgia counties. This area is home to Brasstown Bald , the highest point in Georgia. It contains the headwaters of every major river in North Georgia, and offers hundreds of waterfalls, mountain lakes and dales, and abundant wildlife. Vogel State Park , within the borders of the Chattahoochee National Forest, is Georgia’s second oldest state park. The Fannin County Chamber of Commerce serves as a major force for good in the North Georgia area by maintaining a focus on management of the land within our county. Today, more than 100,000 acres of land in Fannin County is managed by the United States Forest Service. The Blue Ridge Mountains run to the south and west from Pennsylvania. This range contains many famous peaks, including the Shenandoahs. Further south toward Virginia, the countryside segues into rolling hills, and then reverts back to mountain terrain in North Carolina, which contains some of the highest peaks in the Eastern United States. In Southern North Carolina the ridge turns west, and continues into North Georgia and Blue Ridge of Fannin County. Here, the Appalachian Range includes the Benton MacKaye on its western ridge and the Appalachian Trail on the eastern ridge. According to the Chamber of Commerce, “Every Day is a perfect day for a Blue Ridge R&R” . We agree whole-heartedly! Come see for yourself. You’ll find friendly people, a quiet, country atmosphere, and more events than you can shake a stick at!
