If you're looking for quality accommodation that offers good value for money, then choosing a self-catering holiday home is an excellent choice.  It gives you sole use of an entire apartment, cottage, lodge or house, in contrast to a hotel or B&B where you have just a room.   It offers more flexibility ... cook in, eat out, get a takeaway or bring in a chef ... the choice is yours!  It allows you to relax with your whole family including your family pet in some of the best locations. Explore off the beaten trail or feel at home in a new city, the choice is yours. Do we need to say more....?
