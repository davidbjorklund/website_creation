NICE AND HELPFUL We just got home from spending 4 days/3 nights at The Burgundy Inn. The staff was very nice and helpful to us. The rates were the least expensive I could find. And the location was the best, in walking distance to everything we wanted to do! The room was a bit small for 5 people but we weren't there that much so we didn't mind! The kids loved the pool too! - KJSAY - end testi-item I'M SO EXCITED We are headed back down in a few weeks and I'm so excited.
