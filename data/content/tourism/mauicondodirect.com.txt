Our guest book etries: "Enjoyed the beautiful Hawaiian decor & all the extras in the condo - Maholo! We felt that it was a home away from home. The lanai has such a fantastic view & we enjoyed socializing around the BBQ pit. Delightful stay - thanks to the Newton's." Leslie, Rob, Chris & Mike Lemon "It was great coming 'home' at night to your comfortable, convenient, well-appointed condo The gorgeous ocean view from the lanai is the icing on the tropical cake! We hope to come back soon... " Anne Haines, Betty Haines, Pat Perry, Don & Laura Johnson "Thanks so much for everything. This condo is much fancier than our last here. It has a great view of the ocean and palm trees from the balcony. Also to see the sun set on the balcony is outstanding. I could not recommend a better place. When we first walked in here it felt like home. " The Kulhanecks & The Danases "Thank you for making our family vacation in Maui such a postive experience. The condo was great! The boogie boards as well as so many of hte extras were greatly appreciated by our girls (16, 20, 22 yrs). We will certainly recommend this comples to others back in Alberta.
