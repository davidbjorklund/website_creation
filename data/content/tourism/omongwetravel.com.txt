Thank you to Omong'we for making it possible : a fully customised trip for the next day, that's quite impressive. Thanks again - Julien, France I would like to commend you for the efficient and professional service that we received from Omongwe. I appreciated your close follow up, and the effective coordination with your colleagues in Zanzibar. We enjoyed the spice plantation tour as well as the guided tour of Stone Town, very interesting and informative.
