The Farmhouse has been in the family since it was built around 1784.  The house was updated in the 1990’s but, it and the surrounding farm will always be a work in progress.  After many years of growing and selling Christmas trees, haying fields and making maple syrup we have started to scale back.  We have a small vegetable garden and an ever-changing menagerie of animals.  There are chickens, ducks, deer and a donkey.  Our family’s primary occupation is not farming but forestry.  Producing and growing your own food was once a way of life and now it’s our choice.  We invite you to join us and experience a bit of history.
