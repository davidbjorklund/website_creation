It's a super convenient base in The Abacos to not only get some R&R in but also to explore the other islands. There are cabanas on the beach with lounge chairs and food and drink service and a really fun pool bar that is vibrant both day and night. It was so amazing having Cookie (the beach attendant) bring drinks without ever having to get up! Sara B via TripAdvisor Stayed in a Standard Oceanfront room and didn't mind the walk. I ate in the restaurant for all my meals & the food was so good; never ventured off the resort. The crew at the pool bar were so friendly and I felt comfortable. In fact it felt like old friends! My room was 206 & was very large in size, about 600 sq ft or more. The room looked recently renovated & the view was to die for... Linda M via Trip Advisor I recently spent 3 weeks docked there on a boat I work on. I loved it. Great people work there. I hated to leave. I am headed back with my family this fall.
