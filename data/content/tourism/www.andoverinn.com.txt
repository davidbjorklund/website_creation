The Andover Inn offers its guests a unique experience in an intimate setting and is the ideal location for a weekend getaway, family celebration, or corporate retreat.  We are located within walking-distance to the center of Andover, Massachusetts, where the town gives its visitors a “metro-suburban” experience featuring trendy shopping, foodie experiences, and local New England charm.  With easy access to major highways I-495 and I-93, the inn is just 30 minutes from Boston.
