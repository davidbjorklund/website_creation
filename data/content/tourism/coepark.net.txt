Coe State Park Coe Park is the largest state park in northern California, with over 87,000 acres of wild open spaces.  The terrain of the park is rugged, varied, and beautiful, with lofty ridges and steep canyons. Once the home of Ohlone Indians, the park is now home to a fascinating variety of plants and animals, including the elusive mountain lion. Within Coe Park are the headwaters of Coyote Creek, long stretches of the Pacheco and Orestimba creeks, and a 23,300-acre wilderness area. The Pine Ridge Association The Pine Ridge Association was formed in 1975 to assist park staff in providing interpretive and educational programs to the public. It provides funds to support guided walks, evening talks , and the state park's volunteer program. It also sponsors the annual Mother's Day Breakfast, the fall Tarantula Fest and barbecue, the Backcountry Weekend, and other park events.

If we dropped you onto your favorite spot in Henry Coe State Park, blindfolded, and asked you to identify the place by ear, do you think you could? Sound is fundamental to the survival of most animal species. Animals use sound to locate and attract mates, and hearing is a key mechanism for finding prey and avoiding predators. Listen in to see what you can identify in the soundscapes captured by Steve Sergeant, principle investigator with the Nature Sounds Society, on our new Nature Sounds Page . Coe Park in the Summer Summer days in Coe Park can be pleasantly warm and breezy, but other days can be incredibly hot and still. You might want to hike or bike during the cooler hours in the morning or evening and spend the midday hours picnicking or dozing in the shade of a tree. Always pack more water than you think you'll need. Check the  Planning Your Visit page for current conditions.
