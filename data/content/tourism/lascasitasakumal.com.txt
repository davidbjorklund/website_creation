Why have we never stayed here before? The two bed room original casita was wonderfully appointed, ten steps from the beach. We stayed in Casita 4. (Insider Info – There is a hummingbird nest there, but I won’t spoil it for you – you have to sit back, be quiet and find it!) The casita has a fully appointed kitchen, two bedrooms, and two baths. The showers are perhaps the best we’ve ever seen in Mexico! Check in is at the Arches coming in to Akumal, Akumal is an EXTREMELY busy little town with tons of snorkel tours. But, Las Casitas beach is almost private with a beautiful beachfront on the North end of Akumal bay. We met folks from London, Kansas City and Paris. All hanging out in the bay together. Snorkeling in Las Casitas end of the bay is fabulous. We saw Turtles and a big ray just in our little cover. Can’t wait to go back! – Jgera end of slider content end of Slide 1 & background image slider content Las Casitas is the Best place to stay on the Maya Riviera. Started staying here every summer from the time my son was 12 years old to present. My son who is now 30 and had his destination wedding here. Condos are all unique from one another, original Casitas are 2 bedrooms to bath, comfortable and the water is a couple of feet away. Amazing place to snorkel and safe for young children since the water is so calm. Several places to eat in Akumal. If really looking for a place to get away, this is it. You don’t deal with the crowds and commercialization of Cancun and now unfortunately Playa del Carmen. – Ruben O. end of slider content Slide 2 & background image slider content I cannot say enough nice things about this place. We are staying here the last week in September and so far our trip has been perfect. We have contacted the staff a number of times and they have taken care of our every need. They have arranged private trips for us to various Mayan ruins, etc. with total efficiency. We are staying in Casita #3. It is a wonderful little home. Two bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. One room has a King size bed and the other has a double and single. The furniture is comfortable and the beach and entrance to the water is just steps away. If you are considering a stay in Akumal, please give this place a chance. You will not be disappointed. – Francis D. end of slider content end of Slide 2 & background image Slide 2 & background image slider content I’ve been to Las Casitas at least 10 times! Perfect Casitas, perfect beach, private. Lovely private beach away from other travelers. Best snorkeling. Clean location. Patio is wonderfully peaceful. Only steps from the beach. Incredible restaurants within walking distance. – Sherri M. end of slider content end of Slide 2 & background image END: SLIDER END: COUNTERS FOOTER Contact us Phone: US/Canada: 1-800-5-AKUMAL MX/World: (52) 984-875-9071 Email: lascasitasakumal@aol.com © 2016 LAS CASITAS AKUMAL.
