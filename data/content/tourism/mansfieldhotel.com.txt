The Lobby of the hotel was inviting, and the staff was friendly and made me feel very welcome. There is a small library in the front of the hotel that provides a cozy workspace. The Mansfield hotel is truly a rare find in the middle of Manhattan. Great location, beautiful architecture, very comfortable rooms decorated with a lot of character and above all great service. I had the opportunity to spend five days at the Mansfield on West 44th Street and fifth Avenue. It was truly a pleasure and a delight and the accommodations were absolutely fantastic! The rooms had hardwood floors and very soft comfortable beds with the softest linens I think I have ever experienced in a hotel.
