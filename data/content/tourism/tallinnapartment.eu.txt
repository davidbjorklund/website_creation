Earlier we have stayed at hotels, there have been OK. But now hotel times are over, because we found this lovely and cosy apartment. What a great place to stay. Our friends told us about this apartment and we will recommend this also. We had a wonderful holiday here in Tallinn. Maarit Helena Hirvonen, Finland Classic Two-Bedroom Apartment in Old Town Read more I am delighted with this apartment. It is an absolute luxury to have so much space in holiday accommodation. And everything is spotlessly clean, with all the charm of a high-ceiling, thich-wall old-world building. It was comfortably heated and gave a truly home feeling. On top of all this it is perfectly location in the Old City. During the 4 days I speut inTallinn my accommodation was sheer pleasure. I live very far away, but if I should ever have the opportunity to return to Tallinn this apartment is where I would love to stay again – without the slightest hesitation. Gert Steenekamp, Cape Town, South Africa Comfort Two-Bedroom Apartment in the Old Town Read more My experience was one of the best I've ever had. My host was very communicative and arranged a free pickup from the airport. The apartment was clean, spacious, and luxurious. The location might have been the best location in Tallinn. The farthest part of the Old Town was no more than a 10 minute walk, and most restaurants, bars, and clubs were less than 5 minutes away. 5 stars - I would highly recommend to anyone visiting Tallinn. George Li, USA Classic Two-Bedroom Apartment Read more We had an enjoyable stay with the perfect location for sightseeing and walking about. The apartment was comfortable and had all the necessities to make it a home. Mary & Martin Partridge, Vancouver B.C.
