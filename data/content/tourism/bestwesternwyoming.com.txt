Continue Stay Here Travel Regions Things To Do Places to Visit Hotels in Wyoming Welcome to Wyoming! The Cowboy State is the tenth largest in the country but it has the smallest population. Whether you are visiting the state capital, Cheyenne, or smaller cities like Evanston, you’ll learn the frontier spirit is still reflected in the culture. No matter where your travels take you, expect to see spectacular scenery as the High Plains converge with the Rocky Mountains. Yellowstone National Park and Grand Teton National Park are two of the most popular destinations for visitors, but Wyoming is also home to Big Horn Canyon National Recreation Area and Flaming Gorge National Recreation Area. Devil’s Tower was the first National Monument in the United States, and Fossil Butte National Monument is one of the most important fossil sites in the world. See other ancient wonders at the Wyoming Dinosaur Center in Thermopolis and the Medicine Lodge State Archaeological Site. There are numerous historic sites to explore along with several national forests and wildlife refuges. As you travel around the state you’ll notice a strong Native American influence. The Crow, Arapaho, Lakota and Shoshone tribes were the first inhabitants of the region. Reminders of the Old West are everywhere. Retrace the path of The Oregon Trail, see the Buffalo Bill Center of the West and view the hideout made famous by Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. If outdoor recreation is on your agenda, you may want to extend your stay. There are endless opportunities for hiking, biking, fishing, boating and rock climbing throughout the state. Jackson Hole Mountain Resort, Snow King and Grand Targhee deliver excellent slopes for skiing, snowboarding, and winter sightseeing. The National Elk Refuge, northeast of Jackson, offers sleigh rides to view the elk herds from December through April. Take advantage of several scenic byways scattered around the state. Enjoy a road trip to see the fall foliage or view stunning scenery from your car any time of year. Flaming Gorge – Green River Basin Byway offers glimpses of muledeer, pronghorn antelope, and wild horses as you wind past tree-topped mountains and high desert terrain. The dark night skies of Wyoming provide incredible opportunities for stargazing. The ideal combination of wide-open spaces, high elevation and low light pollution make it possible to see planets, stars and nebulae more clearly. Astronomy experts rank Vedauwoo Recreation Area, Wind River Range, Red Desert, Adobe Town, and Antelope Flats the best stargazing destinations in the state. Mingle with locals and other visitors at county fairs, rodeos and festivals. Cheyenne Frontier Days is the world’s largest outdoor rodeo. The 10-day celebration in July features bull riding, steer roping, and pony races along with a parade, carnival, concerts, cooking competitions, and other fun events.
