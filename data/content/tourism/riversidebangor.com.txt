 Riverside Inn - EMMC - Riverside Inn EMMC Riverside Inn Patients & Families Pet Policy FAQ Directions Contact Us Home Patients & Families Pet Policy FAQ Directions Contact Us Welcome Each year, many of our patients travel to Bangor from other parts of the state and Canada for their healthcare needs. Friends and family members often accompany them and want to stay nearby while their loved one is receiving care and/or recovering from surgery. First opening in 1926 as a Nurses’ Residence for nursing students attending Eastern Maine General Hospital School of Nursing, the building became Riverside Inn in 1986, a year after the last nursing class graduated. The Riverside Inn is directly connected to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center via an enclosed passageway and provides a unique and invaluable service to the patients' family members and friends. One of the most comfortable Bangor Maine inns, we are located at 495 State Street in Bangor. Whether in the area for medical needs, business or simply vacationing, the Riverside Inn is proud to provide clean, comfortable accommodations with the amenities and charm of a traditional inn. We provide first-rate lodging in Bangor, Maine!   Hotel Availability The Inn is available for you 24 hours, seven days a week when your loved one is referred to Northern Light Eastern Maine Medical Center via the Transfer Center of Eastern Maine.
