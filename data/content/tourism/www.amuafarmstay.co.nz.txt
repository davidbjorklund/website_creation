Amua Farmstay, Whatatutu, Gisborne, New Zealand page header menu maincolumn WELCOME Nestled near the peaceful settlement of Whatatutu, just 35 minutes west of Gisborne, is Amua Farmstay. Hosted by Julie and Fraser Moore this historic homestead will melt away your stress of city life when you enter the 90 year old villa set in a large established garden with a grass tennis court. And only a few minutes up the road is Amua Cottage, a 30-year-old cottage with large verandah set in a mature garden. Relax and enjoy the farming experience with areas to go horse riding, walking or just soak up the natural surroundings in a private paved area off your bedroom while listening to the chorus of native birds. Bring your golf clubs along and take in the sights of the tranquil Waikohu Golf Course, a nine hole country golf course with wide open spaces. We hope to see you soon.   end maincolumn end page footer HOME | FARMSTAY | HISTORY | WHATATUTU | BOOKINGS | LINKS | CONTACT US Amua Farmstay 853 Whatatutu Road, Whatatutu, Gisborne, New Zealand Â© Copyright 2009 Amua Farmstay | Site design: Flare Media end footer
