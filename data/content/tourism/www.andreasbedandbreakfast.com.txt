Andrea's Niagara Falls Bed and Breakfast offers Special Packages all year. Come indulge yourself to a Romantic Family Getaway vacation in the 2 Bedroom / 2 Bathroom Suite. " Make sure you ask about my Monthly Specials "

A quaint bed and breakfast built in 1892, located in the older, quieter Downtown area of Niagara Falls. I followed my dream and established this historic home into a B&B in 1987. ( I live in a separate section of the house, so that you have plenty of privacy in a nice safe haven ).

Whether you are on Business, Family vacation or looking for a Romantic getaway, Andrea's B&B can offer you a quiet place to relax for your vacation needs. Located one house up from River Road between the Whirlpool and Rainbow Bridges, you can enjoy a beautiful 20-minute walk along the Niagara River Gorge to the Falls, Clifton Hill, Skylon Tower, and Casinos. Only 5 blocks from the Go Transit, Via Rail and Bus Stations and simply steps away from the WEGO Shuttle Bus stop. Nearby, you will discover the Niagara Parks Trails, which is perfect for Biking, Walking, Jogging, Bird Watching or Hiking.

Enjoy a different Breakfast  each morning while you relax in the luminous front porch, garden patio in the summer or in the dining area by the warm and toasty gas fireplace in the winter months. So come and treat yourself to a pleasant stay at our welcoming B&B!
