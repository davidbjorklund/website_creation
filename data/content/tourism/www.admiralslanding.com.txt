Guest Comments: “My $400 budget would barely be enough to pay for a room during Provincetown’s summer season, but in mid-May, just $90 (plus tax) scored me a deluxe room at the Admiral’s Landing, complete with cathedral ceilings and a gas fireplace.” —Christopher Muther ~ Guest Comment Boston Globe “ “…Lodging is the most dramatic bargain of all. Rooms that run $200 or more during the season cost half that on weekends, and even less during the week. Jean and I were first tempted by Admiral’s Landing, a 19th-century Greek Revival whose gorgeous rooms — many of them with fireplaces, a necessity during New England winters, if you ask me — were all $100 or less, with a third night thrown in free during the winter.” —Matt Gross ~ Guest Comment Frugal Traveler, New York Times “Our stay at Admiral’s Landing was amongst our best B&B experiences.” —Tom & Mark ~ Guest Comment Arlington, VA Postcard from The Edge Out & About “We stayed at Admiral’s Landing and, as the sole guests, had the entire run of this wonderfully hosted, perfect B&B, which boasts a fabulous library of all things gay and cultural.” —David Noh, ~ Guest Comment NOH-WAY blog .entry-content .entry-meta #post-2 #comments #content #primary CHECK AVAILABILTY BOOK NOW BEGIN: Constant Contact Email List Form Button Join Our Email List BEGIN: Email Marketing you can trust For Email Marketing you can trust.
