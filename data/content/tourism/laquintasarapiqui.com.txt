This eco-lodge was nationally certified by the Costa Rican Tourists Board' Certification for Sustainable Tourism (CST). La Quinta earned the maximum qualification of 5 Leaves. The CST is a comprehensive program that categorizes and certifies each tourism company to the degree they comply with the model of sustainable tourism. La Quinta strives to have little to no negative impact on its immediate environment.  Every effort is taken to co-exist harmoniously with our surroundings. Our twenty acres are composed of regenerating agriculture, a reforested area with native trees, an old-growth forest on the riverside and tropical gardens. We will always treat our environment with the utmost care and responsibility, and would greatly appreciate your help in upholding these practices while you are here.  Please consider this your home, and your family, during your visit, and help protect what we have held sacred for so many years.  We hope you enjoy the natural beauty of this place as other guests have done before you.     This is La Quinta...
