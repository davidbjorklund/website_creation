If you don't mind a short walk it's 5 minutes to the beach and 40 minute walk to Platanias. A beautiful pool and Helen was very friendly! Excellent value for money! Katie Kelsall UK Nice place, well maintained - short walk to the beach and to the bus stop, with regular buses running around the clock. Gerani is a couple km away from the real tourist bustle, which to us was a plus. This place served us well on our visit to Western Crete. We would give a higher rating but for their unprofessional handling of a refund they owed us, which was eventually settled. Aidan Mc Bennett Ireland Nous avons été très bien accueilli dans ce petit hôtel protégé des grands complexes touristiques environnants. la chambre bénéficie d'une belle vue sur la mer et la piscine, il est idéalement placé pour sillonner l'ouest de la crete! la propriétaire nous a très gentillement accueilli et s'est pliée en quatre pour nous fournir un lit pour notre bébé. elle a été aux ptits soins pour nous durant le séjour et passe tous les jours faire le ménage dans la chambre, ce qui est très agréable! la décoration et les ustensiles de cuisine sont sommaires et suffisant. Pierre Olivier France We were warmly welcomed by the owners who provided excellent directions. The apartment was very clean, comfortable, spacious and air conditioned. It was located in a very peaceful location over looking the sea and beach with a pool. There were plenty of shops and restaurants within walking distance. It also had the added advantage of having plenty of car parking space. We had a wonderful stay - thank you!
