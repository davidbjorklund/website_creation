T. Wentworth Florida State Museum Monday January 21 2019 through Saturday August 31 2019 Originally opened in 1907 as Pensacola's City Hall, this structure is in the Alamo Mission style, somewhat incongruous amid the creole buildings of Penacola's old quarter. T.T. Wentworth was a local eccentric, philanthropist, and collector of miscellany. The museum is an intriguing mix of his own personal (and occasionally peculiar) interests, as well as a general history of the Florida Panhandle and the diverse peoples who have lived here.It's now part of the Historic Pensacola Village association of historic sites. Historic Pensacola Village - the Dorr House Monday January 21 2019 through Monday September 30 2019 Historic Pensacola Village - the Dorr House An organization called "Historic Pensacola Village" offers guided tours of four beautifully preserved Pensacola houses, including this one, the 1871 Dorr House.

Pickens Monday January 21 2019 through Monday September 30 2019 Fort Pickens is a historical military site located within the Gulf Islands National Seashore. It was originally constructed in the late 1820s/early 1830s, with the purpose of protecting the entire Pensacola harbor - which at the time included the most signicant port east of the Mississippi and south of Baltimore. Completed in 1834, it remained in use until 1947. Fort Pickens is named after Andrew Pickens, militia leader from South Carolina and a hero of the War of American Independence.Interestingly, Fort Pickens remained in Union hands throughout the American Civil War.Note: in early September 2012, portions of the Gulf Islands National Seashore park were affected by Hurricane Isaac and closed due to large sand drifts on roads.

A Great Stay We recently stayed at the Noble Manor  while attending a wedding in Pensacola.  We were very glad to have selected this B & B, as it was clean, well appointed and charming.  Bonnie, (proprietor)  is a wonderful cook, and the breakfasts she served were delicious, bountiful, and beautifully plated.  I would have loved to enjoy the  front porch with a cup of her husband Bob's wonderful coffee and the newspaper, but it was HOT in Pensacola in late June..  Should we have the occasion to visit there again, we definitely would return.  The Noble Manor was a highlight of the weekend.  Jon and Pat, Charlotte NC Read more testimonials Friends of the Manor Links, Resources, and more User login Username: * Password: * Create new account Request new password /#sidebar-right Noble Manor Bed & Breakfast 110 W.
