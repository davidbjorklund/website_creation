Enjoy the Cretan hospitality, the change of landscapes from sandy beaches to high mountains until 2.500 m. There are all sorts of relaxing or sports activities. You can visit the archeological sites, which give an impressive picture of the birthplace of western culture. It is a place where you can live nicely all over the year. The climate is mild, even when hot in the summer. There is always a change because of the island situation and a refreshing wind blowing. People are friendly and helpful, very curious and with a positive attitude towards everything new. One has got accustomed to "strangers" like tourists and foreigners working in tourism and other branches. Tourists are welcome. So are the diligent helpers from the north of Europe.   Webpage Design und Copyright: ms marketing hellas 2002 - 2018, questions and comments to:  [email protected]
