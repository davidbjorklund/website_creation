Anthology differs somewhat from most hospitality management companies in as far as our corporate approach is concerned and simply put, in as much as our guests and clients are seldom alike, our establishments also differ from one another. They are however all single minded in their endeavour to provide an experience which does nothing more than leave our guests with only one thought, and that is the desire to return.
