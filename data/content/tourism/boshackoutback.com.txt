I've been here twice-first time was at the bed and breakfast farmstay, second time was at the outback farmstay. Will recommend to everyone. I have been to a few different places. I would rate Boshack Outback as one of the best farmstays in Perth. Cindy Leong It was raining cats and dogs so we did not have the chance to explore the place or star gaze at night but we all love it. Sleeping with natural sound of raindrops hitting the tent was therapeutic. A very lovely place to recuperate. Planning to visit again. Nicole Yuan Review 2 Great food and a wonderful experience. I spent a night here not long ago and it was a relaxing experience. I like it, next time I will definitely stay there again. If you looking Eco-friendly farmstay near Perth, then I highly recommend Boshack Outback.. Wendy Morgan Review 3 Boshack Outback Farmstay in Perth is very peaceful place.
