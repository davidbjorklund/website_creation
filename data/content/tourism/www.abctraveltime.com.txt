I have asked her to plan many complicated trips and she does so with a smile and a can-do attitude! I have worked with Barb for over 20 years and couldn’t imagine planning a trip without her! Bristolbayteacher Wasilla, Alaska We have asked Diane to plan several trips for us (land tour of Alaska, Cancun, Australia, New Zealand, cruise to Alaska) and they have all been wonderful. We were extremely pleased with all the arrangements she made and everything worked well. Her suggestions were invaluable in planning our itineraries. We had basic ideas of what we wanted to see, and she fills in the details with travel plans, places to stay and things to see and do. She responds quickly to any questions we may have and works with us. People wonder why we use a travel agent in Alaska when we live in Idaho, but when you find someone who does such a great job, why go to anyone else? We have recommended her to several of our friends. Diane Shoshone, ID Jeanne Lentz has been our travel agent for over twenty years. She has handled logistics for trips to Europe, South America, and the Pacific. Put simply, she is the best at what she does. We always get personal professional service when we call Jeanne for help planning a trip.
