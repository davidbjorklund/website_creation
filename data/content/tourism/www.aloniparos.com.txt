The mountains and the hills of Paros are smooth and nicely end down to the shores, which rarely become wild by the winds. It is like meltemia (north summer winds) have an informal agreement with Paros. They blow enough to cool off the summer heat but they are not so strong as to make the island wild.

The nature is interesting and rich, provided you want to explore it, to look behind the obvious so as to see things beyond your imagination. Its villages are beautiful and alive but in order to open their arms and let you know them, they don’t want the eye of a tourist but the one of a traveller...
