Kilimanjaro in Northern Tanzania.  Set in a 4.5 acre area, it has been constructed with local Tanzanian materials and designed to combine antique African, and modern contemporary styles, creating an articulate and seductive ambiance. Ameg Lodge is ideal for those visiting Moshi and its surrounding areas.  It is the perfect base for those taking on the Kilimanjaro Challenge and is indeed popular for the pre-climb night as well as the âCelebration Nightâ on the return from the Kilimanjaro trek. Whilst the lodge is located just a few minutes drive from Moshi Town Centre, the tranquil setting of the Lodge creates an atmosphere of being in the beautiful remote African Bush.  This unique feeling and the special Ameg Lodge touch has made it the preferred choice of accommodation for the business and corporate traveller as well. The Lodge is also in close proximity to the Kilimanjaro Christian Medical Centre (KCMC) and the International School Moshi (ISM).

We were there for climbing Kilimanjaro. So, we stayed two nights before climbing and one after coming down. Almost 6 months have passed since then, but we still have pleasant memories of our stay. Some days ago, I was walking with my daughter to her school and she asked me if we are going to take another trip to Africa. I asked her back, - Why? Would you like to climb Kilimanjaro again? - and she responded to me that she want to go to Moshi just for staying at AMEG Lodge and spent some time there with no rush for climbing or safari but lazing end enjoying. She, now 12, enjoyed herÂ´ stay at AMEG Lodge , loved the gardens and trees there, and want to be back to Moshi, not for climbing the Kilimanjaro again, or going to see lions in the safari but for spending some time at AMEG walk on Moshi streets. AMEG Lodge has a kind of soul by itself. It is a pleasant place, quiet and relaxing, clean and well maintained, with very friendly people serving and attending you with an honest smile. Everything is in the right place there. It has nice rooms a good food, nice Kilimanjaro beers at the right cool point, and natural juices for kids. I certainly recommend this lodge. Ernesto Hontoria Oakville,Canada Thank you for lovely hospitality from you and all team of AMEG Lodge . Diana was a very nice lady who took care of us all the time at the restaurant and all the staff had smile on their face. Food was very tasty throughout our stay and the breakfast you organised on our last day was yummy. We had a great time and stay at AMEG Lodge . Ms. Falguni R.
