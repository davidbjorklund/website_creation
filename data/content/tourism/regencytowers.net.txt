REGENCY TOWERS - PCB It’s time… ...  Imagine that your five senses have been awakened.  See yourself on the beach watching playful dolphin’s swim along the coastline.  Hear the waves as they gently kiss the shore.  Who doesn’t enjoy listening to the gentle waves as they break on the shore?  Or watching the sunsets change color as the early evening moves into night.  Imagine those moonlit evenings so clear that you can count the stars in the Milky Way (Earth’s own galaxy).  Smell the salty air as the wind quietly blows.  Feel the powdery white sugar-like sand under your feet.  Taste total relaxation and watch the world at play... ...Those waves bring peace and calm to the soul and rest for the weary. There’s a lullaby that tells us of a place, where the ocean meets the sky, the clouds roll by, and in our dreams we are waltzing the waves, 'diving' the deep.  It’s about a place where the stars are shining brightly, the wind is on the rise, and we hear the whispering words of the “Song of the Sea.” It’s time... ... Enjoy the beauty and ease of an elegant lifestyle with  million-dollar views in one of our vacation condos at surprisingly affordable rates.  Regency Towers is located on a snow white  sandy beach on the Gulf of Mexico, known as one of the most desirable locations on the Emerald Coast.  And, as everyone who visits Panama City Beach, knows... ... ... ... ...  " good vibes happen on the Gulf tides." Regency Towers has been an integral part of Panama City Beach  for over 40 years, and just like ‘fine wine’ we just keep getting better and better!   As a private, gated community, we stand tall with 14 floors and 340 condos with 3 elevators for easy access. We are recognized as a family friendly resort and have activities for all ages. We are   NOT a hotel, but instead offer condos for rent for your vacation that will quickly become your  "hideaway or retreat from life!” Choose to dine in your rental unit, or satisfy your appetite with the freshest and largest variety of local seafood and southern cuisine in the south eastern United States. ACCOMODATIONS: We offer one, two, three and four bedroom units. The amenities at Regency Towers are only a small part of what make our resort unique.  ACTIVITIES NEARBY: At Regency Towers, you are just a short ride from St. Andrews State Park (a nature preserve and bird sanctuary) with calm water at the jetty which is great for teaching the “wee ones” to snorkel in a safe place. And, be sure to check out world-famous Shell Island. To the west, you will want to take advantage of the Pier Park Mall Complex where there are open-air restaurants, clubs and nightlife, unique specialty shops, boutiques and galleries. Staying at Regency Towers is like  having three vacations in one! DOWNLOAD REGENCY TOWERS (OUR HANDY RESERVATION AP) FROM APPLE.COM!
