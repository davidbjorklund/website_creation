Once you’ve been here, you’ll understand why folks love it so much! One of our longtime guests recently confided that she mails her postcards from out of town when she visits so she can keep Frankfort to herself! Well, we can assure our friend of no worries, as the secret’s already out and Frankfort’s being discovered by new visitors who can’t help but agree that it charms. Our beautiful lakefront resort is the perfect place for you to stay and enjoy foodie friendly restaurants, a hopping local brewpub, a restored vintage movie theater, and inviting shopping. But never fear, we’re telling our guest she can happily send her next Frankfort postcard with pride because there’s plenty of room for all and she can mean it sincerely when she writes, “Wish you were here!” Read More… We love our treasure of a town so much we want everyone to experience it. And lately, thanks to some well-deserved recognition, the area is anything but top secret. In addition to our jewel of a beach town, wonderful attractions are just minutes away. Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, which is only 30 minutes from Frankfort, was voted the “Most Beautiful Place in America” on ABC’s “Good Morning America.” And M-22, which winds right through Frankfort, was voted the best “Scenic Autumn Drive” in the country by “USA Today” and “10Best.” Arcadia Bluffs Golf Club, which is just 13 miles south of Frankfort on M-22, is routinely rated as one of the best public golf courses in America. Frankfort is also home to Crystal Downs Country Club, considered among the great golf courses in the world. We invite you to be our guest at Harbor Lights Resort on the beautiful shore of Lake Michigan. Come see what people are talking about. (And what others are trying to keep quiet!) We’re right on the beach — and just a short walk from great dining, shopping, movies and more – in the heart of downtown Frankfort. Come relax, unwind, and play in one of the most beautiful spots in the country. You can tell your friends where you’re vacationing, or keep it to yourself. Either way, we can’t wait to see you! /.main /.content /.wrap Contacts & Directions Nearby Attractions Employment Harbor Lights Resort 15 S. Second Street P.O.
