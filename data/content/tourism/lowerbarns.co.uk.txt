The attention to detail in everything is testament to the hard work and passion of the owners Mike and Janie. Creativity,colour and character give each room an individual feel and charm that is complimented by the owners, and helpers desire for others to enjoy it too.” Recent Guest – Tripadvisor END======================= HOVER BOX ========================== ========================== HOVER BOX ========================== Availability “Cornwall isn’t just about Padstow. For the fresh approach, head south to Lower Barn (near St,Austell), a hidden gem of a B&B perfectly located for exploring the Roseland Peninsula, fishing villages of Mevagissey and Charlestown and the Eden Project. Rooms are as stylish as you’d find in a city boutique, there’s a hot tub, chill-out room and therapies.” BBC Olive magazine END======================= HOVER BOX ========================== ========================== HOVER BOX ========================== Gallery “Perfect! 11/10! The Cat’s Pajamas! Top Notch! Awesome! Fabulous! All words that would absolutely describe a stay at Lower Barn. I’ve yet to find anywhere that would rival it (and believe me, I’ve travelled a lot), but what you can’t adequately describe on paper is the soul of the place, the harmony, the atmosphere created by Janie and Mike and everyone else associated with making this place the heaven that it is.” Recent Guest – Tripadvisor END======================= HOVER BOX ========================== ========================== HOVER BOX ========================== On our Doorstep “We were blessed with the weather but we were even more blessed to have happened upon Lower Barns whilst looking for an upmarket B&B with a hot tub. There is little to say that hasn’t already been said before but it really was a fabulous four night stay. The Hideaway was a dream, the bed was extremely comfortable, the duvet soft and fluffy, breakfast yummy, hot tub hot, gardens beautiful and silent except birdsong to listen to when we opened our eyes in the morning. Janie and Mike were very welcoming and the other guests were delightful.” Recent Guest – Tripadvisor Review END======================= HOVER BOX ========================== BOOKING BOOKING YOUR STAY Time to book your break You can enjoy fresh breakfasts, countryside walks, watch movies from large comfortable beds and indulge in a therapeutic massage or holistic treatments.
