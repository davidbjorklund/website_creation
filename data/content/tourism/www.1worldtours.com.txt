Our aim and purpose is to give you quality time in the temples & pyramids. When you travel with us... *  There is enough time to sit & listen inwardly,  meditate, photograph, sketch or explore on your own. *  You order any food you would like at restaurants *  You see sights not included in the standard itineraries. * We time our visits to avoid the crowds. * SMALL GROUPS : Each tour is limited to 16 participants. An opportunity to fully receive the gifts waiting in Egypt just for you. The most valuable part of a trip to Egypt is the lasting effect that it has on us long after the trip is over.  The insights, personal experiences and knowledge we gain can enlarge us and have a profound influence on our lives from that point on.  Priceless gifts lie in the temples and pyramids awaiting our listening ears and hearts. Most other tours only allow 30-45 minutes at each ancient site, which makes for a hectic pace.  All One World Egypt Tours spend a whole day or afternoon.  Spending more time at each ancient site allows us to avoid the crowds and give each person an opportunity to enjoy the temples & pyramids in their own way -- get those once-in-a-lifetime pictures in the early morning or late afternoon light, sit quietly and take it all in, meditate and see what experiences come to you. We begin each visit with free time, then have lecture & questions with our Egyptian Egyptologist, then more time for photos or exploring.   Our tours give you the chance to really be there. The miraculous awaits. *  UPCOMING TOURS 2019-2020 "Time & Space in the Temples & Pyramids 15-day small-group tour with Ruth Shilling" Private visit inside the Great Pyramid, Tomb of Nefertari, Private Nile Cruise (only our small group), Pyramid of Unas, Abydos, Dendera Hathor Temple, Abu Simbel, Silsila, Tomb of Ramesses V & VI, and all the typical sites.
