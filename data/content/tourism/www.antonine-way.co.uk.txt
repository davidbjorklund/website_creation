Constructed around 142 AD by the Romans to mark the north-west frontier of their empire, the Wall was a mighty symbol of their power and authority. The route made the most of landscape features such as ridges, crests and escarpments to create a forbidding and very visible barrier. Built, occupied and then abandoned by the Romans in the space of twenty years, the Wall has left its mark on Scotland’s landscape. Since 2008, the Antonine Wall has been part of the Frontiers of the Roman Empire World Heritage Site alongside Hadrian’s Wall and the German Limes. Today, you can explore the traces of ramparts, steep ditches, and the remains of forts and bathhouses – and imagine what life was like for the Romans posted on this remote frontier.
