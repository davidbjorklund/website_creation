Take in the stunning views across the Menai Straits or sip a drink on the covered veranda,  Arlunfa is a place to truly unwind. We built the timber-framed house in 1993 to high ecological standards. Its style is simple, comforting and welcoming, combining the traditional with the contemporary and handcraft with modern conveniences. Much loving attention has been spent on many a detail to ensure Arlunfa is a place to come home to. Although the Welsh term is difficult to translate, Arlunfa means something like "Artist's place". Amble down to Penmon Priory, take in the ever-changing colours of the sea, or watch the sunrise behind the mountains of Snowdonia and you'll understand why. /.section, /#content /#main, /#main-wrapper Penmon •  Anglesey • Wales • UK                    Arlunfa.co.uk © 2019 • Imprint /.section, /#footer /#page, /#page-wrapper
