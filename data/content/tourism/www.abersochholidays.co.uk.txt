The nearby coastal path links up to the nearby Hells Mouth (Porth Neigwl), Porth Ceiriad and Cilan common. Our dog friendly accommodation at Mur Cwpwl is just a 5 minute drive from Abersoch village, and its well renowned beaches, shops, restaurants and cafes and the views from the property are spectacular across to the splendid surf at Hells Mouth, around the coast to Abersoch, Pwllheli and then beyond across to Snowdon and the Snowdonia mountain range. If you would like to do some stargazing look no further, the cottages are in an amazing location to view and enjoy some stunning skies with no interference from street lighting, trees or buildings so for some breath taking and memorable sights not only stargaze but you can also see some spectacular sunrises and sunsets. Winter nights are darkest and best for viewing deep sky objects such as galaxies, while in summer you can view the beautiful Milky Way, passing comets and shooting stars.
