A Luxury Apartment in York Page wrap Header Logo Menu Home Information Prices Availability Contact Us Privacy Icon Responsvie Menu Language Bar Header End Menu Responsive Menu Home Information Prices Availability Contact Us Privacy Menu Responsive End When we arrived at the Apartment we were taken aback by how plush it was. The pictures give just a taste of what it's actually like. We had a lovely box of chocs and bottle of wine waiting for us on the table and the children were treated to a box of barney bars. The hosts have put a lot of thought into the decor and must work hard to keep it so clean & up to such a high standard. Also the location is perfect! There is an Asda just over the road, a Chinese within 5 mins walk, Bus stop to Malton & the coast 2 mins walk and you are 5 mins from the City Walls. We had a wonderful time in York and would love to stay at the apartment again in the future. Thank you so much Rita!
