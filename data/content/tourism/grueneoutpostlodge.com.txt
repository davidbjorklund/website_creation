Come on down and enjoy our laid back river lodge in New Braunfels, Texas. You'll find us along the beautiful, tree-lined banks of the Guadalupe River. The Lodge is a place to relax, grab a cold beer, and enjoy exciting activities on the river like tubing and kayaking. We are the only area hotel with tubing on the property where you can float right back to your room. Play a game of volleyball or basketball, dive into the sparking swimming pool, or play video games on the big screen in our clubhouse. If none of that strikes your fancy, head on out to historic Gruene for some boutique browsing, wine tasting, or people watching with an ice cold beer under the trees. Don't forget to check out Gruene Hall, the oldest dance hall in Texas offering dancing and live music. Later in the afternoon, back at The Lodge, relax in a hammock under the canopy of pecan and black oak trees. Fire up one of our BBQ grills and enjoy dining outdoors. As night falls, the fireflies let you know that it's time for a campfire and s'mores. Our accommodations and location, right in the middle of everything, are perfect for Snowbirds or Winter Texans , as they're known by the locals. Many of our rooms have full kitchens and pillow-top beds." "Come see how unique our location is!"
