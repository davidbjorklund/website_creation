"Lovely, historic hotel" Wow! So much history crammed into 1 building! Stayed for 1 evening with my best friend for a catch up. We had the dinner, bed & breakfast deal which was great value. Our room was super, very clean, nice space and interesting explanation for the room name! Staff were lovely, friendly and cheerful, the dinner was very tasty, as was breakfast. There is a large carpark just behind the hotel which is good and the hotel itself is centrally located - I walked from the station - only 10 minutes. We had a super time and we’d recommend the hotel. - Trip Advisor " L ovely Hotel" Spent 3 nights in this lovely hotel, room large and very clean, good internet service, friendly staff. Large car park to the rear of the hotel with free parking. Situated in the centre of town with a number of good restaurants within easy walking distance. When in this area again on business will definitely book this hotel again -Trip Advisor "Historic and unusual hotel" Historic hotel with many interesting features, pictures etc. Comfortable bedroom on the top floor. Very good dinner with friendly and helpful staff. Good choices at breakfast. Large car park behind the hotel. We will definitely stay here again. -Trip Advisor About Us Offers News Explore Frequently Asked Questions Directions Gift Vouchers Facebook <div id="socialfeed563" class="social-feed facebook"> </div> <script id="feedTpl" type="text/x-jquery-tmpl"> <li> <p class="user"><a href="http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=${from.id}" target="_blank">${from.name}</a></p> <p class="message">{{html message}}</p> {{if type=="photo"}} <p class="photo"><a href="${link}" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-photo"></i> View Photo</a></p> {{/if}} <p class="meta">${created_time}</p> </li> </script> <script> $(document).ready(function(){ $('#socialfeed563').facebookWall({ id:'https://www.facebook.com/AngelRoyalHotel/', access_token:'405465092944606|u17uMoHyUZ0sFxmWlP5brxJiHMY' }); }); </script> Angel & Royal Hotel Contact Us Address: High Street, Grantham, Lincolnshire, NG31 6PN Phone: 01476 565 816 Email: enquiries@angelandroyal.co.uk Angel & Royal Hotel As featured on    View Angel & Royal on WeddingDates! ©2019 Angel and Royal Hotel.
