They make everyone feel welcome. They help you discover their towns. They feed you well. They somehow know when you want attention and when you prefer to be left alone. Travelers these days are wise to distinguish: Is this an authentic B&B? When folks just rent out a room or two, that doesn’t make it a bed and breakfast, no matter what a website calls it. Experience a REAL B&B at MBBA member Lewis House B&B in Whitehall(above), where innkeeper Debi Hillebrand will greet you.   /.col-md-4 Rest assured: Safety and quality matter You’re drifting off to a night of sleep… Into the most vulnerable hours of your day… Wait a minute! Location and price are top of mind when we choose lodging, but don’t we deserve accommodations we can trust to keep us safe and secure? Inspections by independent third-party reviewers assure that Michigan Bed and Breakfast Association inns offer safe, clean, comfortable, and well-maintained accommodations. We check details: from pillowcase covers to smoke detectors to the temperature of the fridge. And every MBBA member inn is properly insured to protect you. /.col-md-4 House on the Hill B&B, Ellsworth B&Bs give you a front-row seat to Pure Michigan At the gateway to more than 11,000 crystal-clear lakes, thousands of rivers and streams, and more freshwater coastline than any other state, Michigan B&Bs offer city life, country life, and everything in between. Michigan bed and breakfast stays are synonymous with romance, but people find lots of other reasons to prefer the warmth of B&B hospitality over cookie-cutter hotels. Family vacation? Business trip? Wedding, girlfriends getaway, tranquil retreat? So many different reasons lead guests to our Michigan bed and breakfast inns and keep them coming back. /.col-md-4 /.row /.container /.container-fluid Huron House B&B | Christian Giannelli /.col /.row /.container ONE COLUMN /.container-fluid Find a Michigan Bed and Breakfast /.section_title /.row Search by region to find great places to stay along the way /.col-xs-12 /.row ONE COLUMN /.col /.row /.container-fluid TWO COLUMNS /.container-fluid Discover Unique Experiences /.section_title /.row Match what you love to do with the ideal B&B for you.
