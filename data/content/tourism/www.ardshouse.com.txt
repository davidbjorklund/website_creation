Welcome To Ards House   Ards House Home Rooms & Rates Gallery Location Breakfast Contact We (Steve & Ilze) warmly welcome you to Ards House.  We feel very fortunate to live here in such a beautiful part of the world, with panoramic views across the Forth of Lorn, surrounded by mountains and the Morvern Hills beyond.   Ards House is a traditional Victorian Villa still keeping much of its original charm, warmth  and character.  We have eight  letting rooms, six double, one twin all with en-suite and one single.  It benefits from a large guest car park opposite, on the shores of the Forth of Lorn.  From here many of our guests enjoy to relax watching the spectacular sunsets.  Sea Otters, seals and an array of birds are frequent visitors to our shores.  This season we can also offer two new electric bicycles for hire.   We are located in the small village of Connel.  From the house it is only a short walk to local bars and restaurants, village shop, church, train station and bus stops.  We are only five miles from Oban which is very popular with visitors, famous for its sea food and port with ferry services to a variety of beautiful Scottish islands.  It is an ideal location for exploring the west coast of Scotland, with numerous historic places of interest, never ending scenic views and the magnificent wildlife.   It gives us great pleasure and satisfaction to see our guests enjoy their stay with us, hope to see you soon.   Ards House, Connel, Oban.
