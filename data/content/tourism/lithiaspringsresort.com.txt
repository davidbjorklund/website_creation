The curative springs found deep beneath the resort are rich in sulfur and other numerous minerals to help the body heal, relieve stress, and rejuvenate. The restorative benefits of these healing mineral waters are offered as an amenity to all our resort guests. Enjoy them in the privacy of your own soaking tub, mineral shower, or as an added feature to a spa package. Lithia Springs Resort also offers an outdoor saline swimming pool (seasonal) and Jacuzzi, a sitting area by the koi pond, beautiful cozy indoor spaces such as our Tea Room, Library and two lobby fireplaces to set the ambiance, as well as romantic nooks and hideaways including a gazebo. Interiors and décor are lovingly designed by Owner/Creative Director, Becky Neuman. The resort offers a total of 38 accommodations, including bungalows, suites, and studios. Located just 3 miles from downtown Ashland, it is the perfect location for an intimate escape, fun-filled getaway, romantic wedding, or a family vacation. Our guests enjoy a complimentary made-from-scratch hot breakfast buffet, an afternoon tea with baked goods and fruit, free hotel parking and property-wide Wi-Fi.
