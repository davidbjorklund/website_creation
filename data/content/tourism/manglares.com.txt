It's a small group of indiscreet structures nestled into 4 acres of property bordering the mangrove, creek & forest. Some species of animals live on-site while others traverse twice daily, in the morning and again in the afternoon. It's a camouflaged collection of rooms and cabins connected by trails, raised walkways & bridges supplemented with garden sitting areas, hammocks & open-air lounges. Our accommodations are for people looking for an authentic, tropical experience at a reasonable price. We strive diligently to maintain a healthy level of cleanliness & comfort in this crazy wild spot between the primeval Osa forest of Corcovado & the abundant tropical waters of the "Golfo Dulce" & Pacific ocean.  Common wildlife sightings on the property include: four species of Monkey, Kinkajou, Raccoon, Coatis, Armadillo, Anteater, Sloth, Raptors, Toucans, Scarlet Macaw, Crocodile, Cayman, Lizards, Snakes, Beetles, Hummingbirds, Butterflies, Herons, Iguanas & various other Birds, Insects, Reptiles & Amphibians. When you need a break from the wildlife, kick back and enjoy the colorful surroundings & tropical amenities. The open-air lounge is decorated with beautiful, hand painted murals showcasing the "Monkey Bar" complete with a transparent ceiling and a "suita palm" palapa roof. The large communal kitchen is loaded with everything you need to cook up a storm. It's great for socializing. Enjoy it as much as we have over the years, but please remember to clean up after yourself. If you don't want to cook just order from our neighbours, their menus are placed in the kitchen or go for a walk with easy access to more than 20 eating establishments in town, many of which will deliver their dishes for a small fee. You can walk everywhere in town so a car is not required.  Chosa Manglar Nature Retreat is not just a place to lay your head, it's a truly overwhelming immersion into a tropical environment. It's our family's gift to you, so please enjoy. Check out the photo gallery if you want to see what we're talking about. We recently finalized the purchase of 235 hectares or almost 600 acres of primary rain forest on the Osa Peninsula. We have finally become carbon neutral, a long time family and business goal which we hope aids in your decision to visit us versus so many other options. Guests can now hike and/or camp in the rainforest, at the beach or in town, so ask about our excursions at check in or contact us through the website. If you just can't wait click here to review  Activities, Excursions & Tours .    Pura Vida from Familia Gray Ortega & our entire team.

Mia (Belgique ) Quiet Great location. Friendly staff. Wildlife around. Highly recommended. Mature couple  |  Courtyard Standard Double  |  stayed in 2/2019 Sandra Wonderful quiet place in Puerto Jiminez Our stay here at Chosa Manglar was absolutely lovely. Due to unforseen plan change (I forgot my drivers license at home) we bused from San Jose to Puerto Jimenez, arriving much later than originally planned with our vehicle. Upon arrival, we were greeted, asked if we wished them to order us in some food before everything closed. It is very quiet and the Cabinas are very private. The common kitchen and Salon communal area were spotlessly clean, as were the Rooms/Cabinas. The kitchen was very organized for storage of individuals food. Everyone is very helpful, from night security to front desk. If you have no Spanish, English is spoken. I will be staying there when I make my annual trek to see our dentist. Sandra it's always good to read that our guests feel welcomed when they arrive. Thanks for the kind words. We look forward to your next visit.

It was located exactly in the middle between the bus terminal and the beach (approx 10min walk from each). The hotel is all surrounded by nature, so you can see trees, flowers, butterflies and even a family of spider monkeys that came very close. The rooms are very clean, with private shower and bathrooms, and they have air conditioning. The people at the front desk were really helpfull and nice. We booked a trekking tour with the hotel that went on the border of the Corcovado for half the price of what agencies around proposed. The tour was really great, with guides showing us a lot of animals (monkeys, crocodiles, aras, toucans,etc) and giving explanations for medicinal and edible plants. We also got to drink A LOT of excellent coconut water. I greatly recommend this hotel, it was the best in our whole trip in Costa Rica!
