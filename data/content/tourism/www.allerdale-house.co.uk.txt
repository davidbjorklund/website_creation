Allerdale House Guest House Keswick Bed and Breakfast B & B Keswick Welcome to Allerdale House in the Lake District market town of Keswick on Derwentwater. Allerdale House is a 4 Star Silver Award Guest House B&B offering high quality bed and breakfast accommodation exclusively for adults with private car parking for all guests cars and free wifi throughout the house. Winners of Keswick In Bloom. Allerdale House is an interesting and impressive Lakeland Stone building built around 1877 for a local dignitary. It now offers full en-suite accommodation with all the facilities associated with a small personally run guest house and is one of the few guest houses in Keswick owned and run by a local couple Paul and Barbara, both born and raised in Keswick. Situated in a quiet residential area it is less than five minutes' walk from the interesting Keswick town centre, where you will find a good variety of eating places, shops and visitor attractions. We are also a short stroll to the Theatre by the Lake and the shores of Derwentwater. We are a great base for a relaxing holiday at any time of the year so whenever you stay with us you can experience the peace and tranquillity of the Lake District National Park and many of the famous walks start from our front door. Why not come out of season when you can take advantage of our 'out of season' breaks? The Lake District countryside is still beautiful and there are less people on the fells. Allerdale House is recommended by Rick Steves U.S.A. Travel Guide.
