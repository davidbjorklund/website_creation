There is no English translation of this Austrian word, but imagine a cozy, historic, welcoming mountain inn with a roaring fire, deep chairs, fabulous food, delicious wines and hot drinks, great friends, lots of laughter and music. It is an atmosphere that welcomes you with open arms, makes you feel instantly at home and says there is no rush, take your time, relax, enjoy, be happy and content. This is where life is good, people are friendly, atmosphere genuine, and you never want to leave! The hotel is located next to the Jackson Hole Aerial Tram. ¬† The Alpenhof Lodge is listed in the National Register of Historic Places ¬† Alpenrose Awards: ‚ÄúRomantic‚Äù ‚ÄúBest Overall‚Äù and ‚ÄúSpecial Occasion‚Äù Instagram Feed Cheers to the #WeekendWarriors out there.
