There is absolutely nothing to fault with Araluen Boutique Accommodation. From the perfect hosts to the immaculate quality appointed villas, everything is of the very highest standard. Spotlessly clean, warm and inviting with peaceful serene views, the only issue is that we didn't stay long enough. That will be remedied when we return in the warmer months for a longer visit. Could not recommend highly enough! Chris 9 July 2017 Thoroughly enjoyed our villa. We have stayed in quite a few places in the Yarra Valley and this was one of the best. Leisha 7 August 2017 Very comfortable in a picturesque setting. Very friendly and helpful hosts. Kerry 6 May 2017 Congratulations on your purchase of the property. You have been working hard and the gardens looks great. We really enjoyed our stay and look forward to returning. Wishing you the very best for your family in this new adventure. Gavin & Louisa 8 June 2017 We stayed here with our friends from Sydney last weekend I have to say the whole experience was absolutely fantastic, Rachel was the hostess with the most'est. Her passion and kindness made our experience one to never forget. The villas /linen/products and oh Fresh eggs daily from the chickens were perfect. Thank you for making this holiday memory this will never be forgotten. We will return and tell all love the Dawson's. 2 August 2017 If you are looking for a relaxing weekend away in the Yarra Valley with your choice of stunning restaurants and wineries on your door step, then a stay at Araluen Boutique Villas is a must. Your gracious hosts, Rachel and Neil Hansen, are a wealth of knowledge and happy to offer advice and suggestions regarding local eateries and attractions that will best match the experience you are looking for.

Your villa itself is your self-contained patch of paradise and the perfect base from which to explore the Yarra Valley. Each villa has a kitchen with fridge, cook top and convection microwave plus crockery, pans and cutlery, allowing you the option to cook a casual evening meal relaxing in comfort in front of the roaring gas fire after a full day out and about exploring the local sites. Breakfast provisions are included, with the resident chickens laying fresh eggs daily that you are welcome to gather yourself or spend some time picking citrus from the on-site trees laden with fruit (lemons, oranges, grapefruit, mandarins plus olives and pears).
