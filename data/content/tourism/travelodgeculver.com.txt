"Great value for the money" I spent 5 nights here, and had zero issues, everything worked great and staff was easy to work with. Quiet enough for me, though I'm a deep sleeper. For the money, this hotel was a great value. "Great Location! Close to Beaches & LAX Airport" I was attending an annual get together and this hotel is close to everywhere I needed to go, been here once before and plan on returning again next year. Been to other Travelodges and this is by far the best I have come across to date. Large rooms, nice amenities.
