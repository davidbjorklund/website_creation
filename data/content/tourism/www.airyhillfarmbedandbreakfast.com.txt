What do you long for mostâ¦ More time with loved ones? Good food and rest? The chance to explore a scenic farmland community?   We can offer all that and more. Airy Hill Farm Bed and Breakfast is a strikingly beautiful retreat. Pastures wrap the hillside house and gardens, which overlook woodland and a stream in one direction and mountains and farm fields in the other. The clean-lined house takes full advantage of the site. A vaulted ceiling and bank of windows in the main living area bring the outdoors in, while decks and porches invite guests back outside. Soft, earth-toned wall colors change with the progression of light. Family antiques and art pieces combine with a fresh modern layout.       There are plenty of great activities to do here and nearby (see On the Farm and Attractions ), and plenty of ways to idle away an afternoon as well. We recommend the front porch rockers, the side porch or back deck as places to relax. Whether weâre home base for local adventures or a destination unto itself, expect comfortable rooms, a hearty breakfast, and a friendly welcome. Feel free to check out reviews on Trip Advisor as well as in the newpapers . Come and enjoy all that our corner of the world has to offer here in Lancaster County, the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country! end .content InstanceEndEditable airyhillfarm@dejazzd.com (717) 664-2159 1741 Airy Hill Rd., Manheim PA 17545 ©2017 Hathaway Web Designs        end .container
