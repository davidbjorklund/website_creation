There is not much more we can say other than if you are going to visit Provo, Turks and Caicos; this MUST be your place to stay. There was nothing amiss in this house. Private beach, kayaks for your use, private pool, each bedroom with their own bathroom attached, fully loaded kitchen with all the pots and utensils you could need, a gas grill, hammocks to day dream on and the perfect ice maker machine! We have travelled the world and have made it a point to never stay at a hotel, we want to be apart of the community. This house was the perfect fit for our needs. We were able to visit the grocery not to far away, bring groceries in the house and enjoy our time at “home” secluded from the masses of the other side of the island. If you want a private area that is quite and large enough for everyone in your party to be relaxed and not on top of each other this is your place. We have already discussed our return visit and we will most definitely be staying here. We have also bought one of those awesome ice maker machines for ourself!  Ran . Thanks so much for sharing your beautiful house with us. We will visit again.   Thanks! Heaven on Earth Christie. My mother in law rented this property for her 40th wedding anniversary and took 8 of us along with her. The view both looking to and from the house is simply stunning. Sleeping was a little tight with 9 of us, but thankfully 3 were kids so it was easy to make it work. 6 adults would be the most recommended. But the beach was perfect for our young ones (age 1 & 4)...the water is shallow for almost a mile out so they could play waist high easily. Between the private pool, hammocks, perfect beach and all the comforts of home, we had an amazing week, we didn't want to come home! great last minute getaway Tim O.. We just returned from Villa Tropidero a little over a week ago. We had a great time. Last year we stayed in North Caicos and loved the privacy but for a younger crowd, the solitude was a little too much. So this year, we decided to stay in Provo to be closer to the action, when and if we wanted. The balance was much to our liking; when we wanted to head out for the night to hit one of the night spots, it was within 10-15 minute drive. For cases where we wanted to stay close to home, the local watering hole was just down the street. The house was perfect for our needs, living space was more than comfortable, pool was great for the late afternoon to cool down, and the beach and crystal clear water checked all the boxes. At night, having dinner in the breezeway was just the right way to finish the day. For our stay, there were three couples so the bedrooms worked out great. Having morning coffee on the second floor balcony looking out over the ocean was the perfect to start to 7 straight days of 85+ degree weather. We surely enjoyed ourselves. Peaceful, comfortable, convenient Diane C.. Two friends and I spent a wonderfully relaxing week at Villa Tropidero. We loved having a private beach just steps from the house and were amazed at how few people we saw when we were at the beach. The Turtle Tail neighborhood is very quiet, yet it is very fast and easy to get to the airport, the grocery store, lots of good restaurants, and Grace Bay. The property lived up to its description on VRBO and is well maintained. It was super-easy to get in touch with the staff on the island and with the US-based owner when we had questions; everyone was as helpful and responsive as could be! We would definitely come back and would recommend the property to others. Sublime tranquility, perfect beach, sunsets. James M.. We dined under the stars having had the best of days. Great location. We would thoroughly recommend Villa Tropidero. Villa Tropidero is wonderful! Dave W.. My wife, two daughters and I thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Villa Tropidero. Having our own private beach, pool, gorgeous views of the Caribbean, and all the comforts of home made our time on the island as stress-free and relaxing as possible. We decided not to rent a car but instead used Green’s Taxi service to get into Grace Bay, which is about 15 minutes away, for dinners or shopping. In addition, the owner, Pam was extremely responsive to all inquiries and requests. She also has a property manager on the island to take care of any needs. If you prefer to be in a clean, beautiful, peaceful, quiet oasis during your trip to Providenciales, then I would highly recommend Villa Tropidero. © 2019 villatropidero.com. All Rights Reserved.
