Therefore we do not accept bachelor/bachelorette parties, spring breakers, anyone under 25 or groups over 10 people. It’s nothing personal – we just know from experience that it won’t work. This is a small property with a small pool area and limited seating so anyone looking to accommodate numerous guests or to have a party will not leave happy. I’ve been accused of running an “old folks home” for shushing people and I’m okay with that. We want you all to have a great time while visiting our island even if it means that you would be happier at a different hotel, because that is the bottom line, your happiness. -Mike and the gang” Array Rooms Specials ▼ Packages Eden House Rewards Events Regulaaars Our Property ▼ Web Cams Azur Restaurant Gallery Property Tour Location About Eden House ▼ History Hotel Features Press Key West Green Hotel Talk To Us ▼ Hotel Reviews Mike’s Blog Newsletter Mike’s Opinion Discover Key West Weddings
