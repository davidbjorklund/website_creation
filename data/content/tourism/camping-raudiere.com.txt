There is so much to discover just around every corner. For the sporty types there is karting, horse riding, canoeing, golf, walking, cycling. Nearby in Saumur, Angers, Brissac QuincÃ© and Montreuil Bellay there are fabulous chateaux, restaurants and shops. The nearest towns are Vihiers (10 km) and Argenton (10 km) both have post offices, bakers, banks, supermarkets, bars and restaurants. Even nearer still are the villages of St Paul du Bois (Maine et Loire) and St Maurice la Fougereuse (Deux-SÃ¨vres) and each have a bar/restaurant, shop and/or bakery. We are in the heart of the Anjou region so you are never far away from a wine âcaveâ where wine tasting is an absolute must. Try the rosÃ©s, the fruity whites and the light Anjou rouge. The area around Saumur is also reknowned for its sparkling wines. Nearly every weekend in summer, there is a fete not too far away. In St Maurice Ãtusson you will find the 'fete de la moule' in early July (check the events page) where you can join the locals at lunchtime eating moules and frites (mussels and chips), listening to music and soaking up the atmosphere. One of the best festivals just 10 minutes away is the music and wine festival âFete du Patrimoneâ at AubignÃ© sur Layon. Local viticulturers bring their wines for you to taste, matched with fabulous food and everywhere you go in the village you can discover live music to help you soak up the atmosphere. This fete is usually held on the last Sunday of August. The streets are also lined with stalls of local arts and crafts. The food is overseen by a Michelin star chef who has a restaurant in Angers. Please check our events page for the date. Other great days out are the Zoo at DouÃ© la Fontaine , Futuroscope at Poitiers, Puy du Fou at Epesses and Pescalis Fishing Village at Moncoutant. % Start of the content for CoffeeCup Responsive Content Slider % Pescalis Fishing Village, Moncoutant Pescalis Aquarium, Moncoutant Futuroscope, Poitiers    Puy du Fou, St Herbiers Zoo de DouÃ© la Fontaine % End of the content for CoffeeCup Responsive Content Slider % The Beach Vibe Campsite Facilities Camping la RaudiÃ¨re is a privately owned campsite with mobile homes.
