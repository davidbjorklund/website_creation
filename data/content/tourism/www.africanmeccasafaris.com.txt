There were four of us including myself, my wife and our friends that we have been traveling with for 20 years. By way of background, we are very experienced travelers, have visited over 40 countries, several more than once, and this was our third visit to Tanzania. As a result, our objective was to have some different experiences and visit new areas. The ladies in our party are fans of Jane Goodall so Gombe was on the list, we couldn’t imagine a trip there without visiting Ngorongoro Crater and a combination of Ruaha and Selous looked to get us new experiences and an ability to get out of the vehicles and do some nature walking. While looking for an “upscale” trip, the primary objective was to optimize our overall experience and not just opt for the fanciest places.
