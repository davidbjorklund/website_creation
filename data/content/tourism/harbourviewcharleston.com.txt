Not only is it in the heart of Charleston and within walking distance of just about anything. - Tim L “Great hotel, great location!” Stayed for our 35th honeymoon. Arrived to a nice bottle of champagne and welcome note in our room! From that start, to the afternoon wine and cheese, to the evening cookies and milk, it was all great. - Ronald B “A wonderful Getaway!” I really enjoyed the time I spent at The HarbourView Inn. The view from our room was fantastic and the hotel staff really knows how to make you feel at home! - Emfn3 <img src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/assets/images/gallery-1.jpg" alt="Fountain"> <img class="lazyload " alt="Fountain" src="data:image/svg+xml;utf8,&lt;svg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='681' height='347'&gt;&lt;path fill='#ffffff' fill-opacity='0' d='M0 0h681v347H0z'/&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;" data-srcset="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/assets/images/gallery-1.jpg"> <img src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/assets/images/green-logo.jpg" alt="Logo Background"> THE Gallery Through our lens Learn More <img src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/assets/images/gallery-2.jpg" alt="Bedroom"> <img src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/assets/images/gallery-3.jpg" alt="Chapel View"> Explore Charleston’s soulful side Waterfront Park 45 ft | 1 min walk Charleston city market 0.3 mi | 3 min walk Rainbow Row 0.3 mi | 6 min walk The Battery 0.3 mi | 6 min walk King Street 0.3 mi | 6 min walk View Interactive Map / #content Press FAQ Careers Contact Us facebook instagram 2 Vendue Range Charleston SC, 29401 Local: (843) 853-8439 Toll Free: (888) 853-8439 Sign up to receive exclusive offers, events and updates Downtown Charleston HarbourView Inn , its website, and its ownership and management, all based in the United States, collect and use this information as described in "Our Privacy and Cookie Policy" . <script defer src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/frontend/includes/js/jquery-validate/jquery.validate.min.js"></script> <script defer src="https://harbourviewcharleston.com/frontend/includes/js/jquery-validate/additional-methods.min.js"></script> Thank you for your interest.
