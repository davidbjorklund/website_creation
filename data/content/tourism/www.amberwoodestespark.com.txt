We are about midway in the scenic 5-mile drive between the Town of Estes Park and the North entrance to Rocky Mountain National Park. A variety of birds, deer, elk, bighorn sheep, bears, fox, chipmunks, and marmots grace our surroundings throughout the year. Appropriate apparel, footwear and vehicle selection should be considered for weather and road conditions; our location on a mountainside with steep dirt roads within our grounds strongly suggests vehicles with four- or all-wheel drive during snowy times of the year since our snowplowing efforts leave some snow behind and the sun doesnât melt it quickly. We invite you to come and experience the warm, friendly atmosphere and become part of the Amberwood family! Owned and operated by the Clements family since 1972.
