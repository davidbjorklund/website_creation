"We have experienced so many of the great chalets that Mountain Laurel Chalets offers. We have been using the wonderful service for over 30 yrs, and have yet had a bad experience. I LOVE the Smokey Mountains, and you all just bring up the level of Great,,,, Will continue to use your service and recommend it to everyone we know. Thank you all!" Susan Elks Cameron "We have used Mountain Laurel Chalets several times and have yet to ever be disappointed. They have always exceeded our expectations and handled all of our needs with professionalism and courteousness. It is truly home away from home when we come to the mountains and use Mountain Laurel Chalets." Jennifer Pannell "Just wanted to share that I've been coming to Gatlinburg since I was a young girl with my parents on vacations...and Mountain Laurel Chalets was the one cabin experience I'll never forget....I'm almost 40 now, and I hope someday my kids will be able to experience the wonderment and and excitement of staying in a ROUND house! I remember it had 3 floors and a VCR (which was awesome back then!) We thought we were living like kings that week." Shoo Sorrentino "We love Mountain Laurel Chalets!!! We go to Gatlinburg once or twice every year & this is the only company we will use! The Chalets are clean & spot on with our needs! Plus their customer service is top notch!!!" Alison Dreibelbis "From our honeymoon 15 years ago to our family trip last winter, Mountain Laurel Chalets hold many special memories for our family!" Lisa Simmons Denning "We have been renting from Mountain Laurel for 28 years! They are the best! We have never had any problems and all of the Chalets have lived up to our expectations! Planning to visit this winter!!" Juanita Wiggins "My family has always stayed with Mt Laurel chalets starting with my grandparents. My husband and I honeymooned in one of the chalets and we've stayed on one with friends. We're looking forward to planning a trip in the next couple years." Kim Janning-Cox "I have been coming to the Smokies since the late 1970's, and have stayed with other companies, but almost all of my trips since the 1980's (sometimes 2 or 3 visits a year, if I was lucky) have been in a Mtn. Laurel property. The rates are good, you are not charged for a bunch of "extras" that should be included anyway, the chalets are well maintained, if there is a problem they are right there to fix it, and customer service is superb. Always friendly and accommodating. My next visit is November, and I can't wait to get back to the mountains and Laurel Lodge."
