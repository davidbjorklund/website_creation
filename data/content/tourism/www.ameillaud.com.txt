Our domain is situated in Cairanne, in Provence. A vineyard and a charming holiday rental anchored for a long while in a viticultural tradition   A charming provencal vineyard Cairanne, upgraded to Cru status in 2016, is a small village situated to the east of the Rhône river, between Orange and Vaison la Romaine. It is here that l’ Ameillaud vineyard is established, under the pure summer light vivified by the mistral. The starting point was between 1850 and 1860 …. Local farmers settled on the site of La Meyeau, as it was so called in the 19th century, leaving their “fermette” to the west, attracted by spring water, planted some vines, built a house, stables and winery... Alongside the winery and tasting activities such as Wine Tours, l’Ameillaud invites you to stay at the heart of its vineyard in the domain’s old stables, today converted into a large, characterful house, Mas Meyeau .
