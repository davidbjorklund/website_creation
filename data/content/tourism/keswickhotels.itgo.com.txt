WELCOME!! Having admired the stunning view from the front lawn, step inside and move along the beautiful hallway and up the magnificent pine staircase. Have a look at our bedrooms.  They are all en-suite with bathrooms.  They mostly have made to measure pine furniture, together with all the facilities which you would expect to find.  Naturally they are all centrally heated.  The rooms on the front share the same wonderful views of Skiddaw and the valley. Go to the next page to find out more about the food you can savour having enjoyed a pre dinner drink in our cosy bar, or in the lounge admiring the view you see here on the left.
