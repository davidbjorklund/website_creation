We thoroughly enjoyed our stay, it was very comfortable, clean, and neat, and we loved the decor. We also appreciated how well equipped it was and enabled us to do all kinds of fun things, ranging from baking to biking. We would definitely seek to stay there again on our next trip (which at this time is much too far away). Thanks again!" (Todd and Shannon) ..."if my memory is correct, I believe you said you were heading to SR on the 20th, which means your there now, for which we are both totally envious!" 5/Out of 5-Stars We all LOVED the house! "My husband and I stayed here with his mother and her husband, This was their introduction to Central Oregon and Sunriver (they are from Ohio). We all LOVED the house! So wonderfully appointed, spacious and yet with a cozy cabin feel. The amenities were wonderful (the bikes were all in great condition and this was really important since we all are avid riders) and made our stay all the more pleasant and relaxing. When we had a problem with the WiFi (it turned out we didnt have an ethernet cable oops) the owner was very helpful and even called us back to see if our problem had been resolved! I loved the cozy furniture....so comfortable you didnt want to move. The kitchen had everything and it was all quality down to the last wine glass. There were deer that visited everyday as well as Stellar jays and grey squirrels. All in all we would highly recommend this house to anyone who wants a memorable stay in Sunriver!

"Deb and Rob, Thank you so much for our relaxing four days. We had a wonderful time and that house has everything you could ever need or want for a wonderful vacation. We took your advise and ate lunch at Jackson's Corner on the way down and a late breakfast on our way home today. It was wonderful. Last night we had a fabulous meal at Southend Bistro. (definitely going back there!!) The rest of our meals we enjoyed preparing in the well stocked kitchen. Deb, you were right , we didn't want to come home. The weather was gorgeous, the deer entertaining and we spent many hours enjoying your backyard (reading and chatting). Thank you again!"

Your information, communication ahead of time about the house and the surrounding area enabled us to prepare for our trip ver knowledgably. Thank you very much! The openness of your house with the kitchen, dining & living room all connected made it possible for some of us to be reading while others were playing a game at the table, and still others were preparing a meal and yet feel like we were all in the same room. That was very nice! Thank you for all of the furnishings and the amenities of your home for our use. During our stay we ate a delicious steak dinner served hot off the gas grill, we soothed our tired skiing muscles in the hot tub, we pedalled down the quiet Sunriver paths using your bicycles, we often warmed ourselves by the gas fireplace and we relaxed watching evening videos on the large TV screen. Thank yiou very much! There was certainly plenty to do in and around Sunriver, so we never lacked for enjoyable activities. Our time at Mt. Bachelor was vey nice and we are still amazed at the 30 min. drive dor-to-door! All in all, we had a wonderful family vacation!"

The kitchen is stocked with every utensil and gadget one could desire. The rooms are spacious and are decorated to perfection.
