Upon checking out, we received a phone call informing us that my husband had left his eye glasses behind in our room. It was offered to have them mailed back to us, which we thought was so nice and accommodating. We will continue to stay at Las Posadas as we have been :) https://lasposadasofsedona.com/praise/ever-stay-las-posadas-visiting-sedona/ .testimonial_rotator_microdata Las Posadas facility is the perfect place to stay in Sedona Your facility is the perfect place to stay.

[ read on ] Eric Hotel 5.0 2016-10-17T15:02:36-07:00 Eric Well, first off thank you for having my GF and I at your Hotel. Although I was only there for one day, we thoroughly enjoyed our stay. The rose petals were there when we walked in and it was a well-received romantic gesture. The room was incredibly decorated with updated features and lots of quality amenities: fireplace, the bathroom and kitchen were very nice and I liked the open floor plan and patio. Although it was too cold for the pool, the hot tub was very enjoyable. The breakfast in the morning was tasty and the cook was a very nice woman. Eating breakfast out on the balcony was beautiful. The front desk staff was very accommodating and friendly. And the cookies were way too good. I also liked the recycling options as many hotels don't participate in that, although I couldn't find one for glass; No big deal. Oak Creek has solid amenities and being only a scenic 15 minute drive from the shops of Sedona, we appreciated the privacy. We will be returning on our next opportunity. https://lasposadasofsedona.com/praise/will-be-returning-next-opportunity/ .testimonial_rotator_microdata Everything was wonderful!

We were pleasantly surprised by the kindness of the staff and the accommodations were better than expected.  We can't thank you enough for allowing children to stay at your inn.  It was so difficult to find a place that would consider taking children.  Because you were open to accepting children, we will continue to use your inn every time we visit Sedona. Please be sure to tell the woman that cooked breakfast she did a fantastic job.  She was just super, cooking for everyone, cleaning tables, making sure the guests were o.k.  She really has a hard job and I hope she gets the credit she deserves for it. https://lasposadasofsedona.com/praise/much-enjoyed-staying-las-posadas/ .testimonial_rotator_microdata My husband and I absolutely loved your hotel Our only regret was that we could not stay longer.
