The  White Cabin   a later extension to the house to accomodate the then owners collection of mechanical toys, sleeps two in a bedroom/sitting room and fitted kitchen. Achnadrish  is ideally located amidst the wilds in rural central north Mull, 5 miles from Tobermory and 2 miles from Dervaig, close to the pristine white beaches, lochs, and miles and miles of tracks that make Mull such a special and unspoilt  island. There are masses of  things to do   and please  contact us   if you have any enquiries Please note, Achnadrish is a family home with free range hens and 2 very friendly pigs, Rose and Clementine, who are kept in an area in the front garden as well as other areas around the property. Dogs and ponies also live here! We do our utmost to respect your privacy, the dogs are kept at the back of the house and the Wing and the Cabin have their own private entrances,  but occasionally a hen may land on your window sill asking for food!
