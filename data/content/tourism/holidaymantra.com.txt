I am glad you have cooperated in all regard for booking the entire package. I am looking forward for good trip of unique Utrranchal. - Mr. Gaurav Kalya <div class="w3_testimonials_grid_right"> <img src="images/test3.jpg" alt=" " class="img-responsive" /> </div> " Everything was pretty well arranged by HolidayMantra . It was quite a memorable trip for the four of us. All Seasons in Pattaya is a nicely positioned hotel with lovely surrounding and close to all places. Sightseeing trip along with guides Johny and Sumi was also well-arranged. Coral island is beautiful but the food quality that was provided on the island by Seven star was not that good. We do look forward to making another trip with you guys. Thanks a lot. - Mr. Satyajit Karunakar <div class="w3_testimonials_grid_right"> <img src="images/test4.jpg" alt=" " class="img-responsive" /> </div> //testimonials Newsletter <div class="w3layouts_newsletter_right"> <div class="container"> <div class="col-md-4 n-left"> <h6>Newsletter</h6> </div> <div class="col-md-8 n-right" id="newsletter"> <form action="inserttestimonail.php" method="post"> <div class="input-flds"> <input type="text" name="name" placeholder="Name" required=""> </div> <div class="input-flds"> <input type="email" name="email" placeholder="Email" required=""> </div> <div class="input-flds"> <input type="submit" value="Subscribe"> </div> </form> </div> <div class="clearfix"></div> </div> </div> //Newsletter Address Holiday Mantra #380, 1st Floor, Sampige Road, B/W 8th & 9th Cross, Opp Old Library, Malleswaram, Bangalore - 560003 Karnataka India Contact Us +91 9845664340 +91 8277683707 Mail Us holidaymantra@gmail.com Payment Options 2018 All rights reserved | This Site is made with by Manas //Footer //smooth scrolling gallery gallery flexSlider //flexSlider stats //stats start-smoth-scrolling start-smoth-scrolling here stars scrolling icon //here ends scrolling icon js for bootstrap working Responsive-slider // Responsive-slider stats //stats start-smoth-scrolling start-smoth-scrolling here stars scrolling icon //here ends scrolling icon js for bootstrap working //for bootstrap working script-for-menu //here ends scrolling icon
