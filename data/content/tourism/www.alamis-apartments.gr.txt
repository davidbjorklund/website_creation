Ideal shelty01 - September 2017 We've just returned from two weeks at the Alamis. We're missing it already! Located close to the lovely beach and lots of fantastic restaurants it's in the ideal location. It's very clean, maid service is daily, rooms are lovely and comfortable and there's always plenty of hot water. The Pool and adjacent Bar are excellent, the service from Christos, Jimmy and George is first class, snacks around the Pool are very reasonably priced and delicious. There are lots of guests who return each year who obviously love the Alamis and are all too willing to share their local knowledge. The Family running the Alamis are lovely, very helpful, friendly and accommodating, nothing is too much trouble for them. Air Conditioning, a safety deposit box and a hair dryer for bald men to dry their flip flops are in all rooms. We had a two bedroom apartment with a lovely balcony with table and chairs ideal for sitting out. We will definitely be returning to the Alamis. A Little Gem in a perfect location - murphys892017 UK - September 2017 We stayed at the Alamis In August for two weeks. We came with family for our wedding. The staff are amazing . Pool is clean and a good size, Would recommend getting up early for a decent lounger though. Location is perfect, well placed for beach and resort centre. Snacks & breakfast served at the bar are reasonable and really nice!! Air con is a must in the high summer and ours was approx 80 euro for two weeks. We had a two bed apartment with 2 balconies and it was lovely and spacious. Would definitely return, thanks so much to Anastasia & team xxx Love this place !!!! - KaS9994 - September 2017 My partner and I stayed at the Alamis for 2 weeks (16th to 30th Jul) and loved every minute of it. Lovely family who own it, nothing is too much trouble. The rooms are basic and comfortable. They are cleaned very well, bins emptied every day, regular towel and bed changes. There is a hairdryer too ladies, so you don't need to pack one! Lovely pool area and bar serving very tasty food. The Alamis is perfectly located, 2 mins to the beach and 2 mins to the main road thru Tsilivi with it's huge choice of restaurants. We were in room 30d at the back, good sized balcony which we used every day. All the staff are very friendly and absolutely love it if you try out a few Greek phrases. Christos is behind the pool bar during the day is extremely funny and very attentive. Dimi (owners son) looks after the bar in the evening and is brilliant- talking of Dimi, you must book for the Greek night - amazing evening and one of the best if not the best Greek night I've been to,....
