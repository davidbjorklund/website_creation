Our cottage is spacious, accommodates 4 persons, comfortably decorated, a non-smoking residence, available all year round and welcomes dogs! Please see our 'Accommodation' page for more details regarding our property.   About Ballater The village of Ballater is nestled by the River Dee and is surrounded by hills and heather, and is a perfect destination for those seeking a quiet, relaxed escape. Ballater is a friendly village and has a variety of unique independant local shops, a large supermarket, events, cafe's, pubs and restaurants on your doorstep.  Alistair and Margaret Cassie; the owners of 'Inverey', also run a local hardware shop in the village. Alistair is a 'local loon' born and bred, therefore extremely knowledgable on local history, things to see and do on Royal Deeside. The village and surrounding areas offer golf, fishing, horseriding, skiing, mountain biking, hill-walking and climbing. 'Balmoral Castle'; summer home of the Royal Family for generations, is only a 15 minute drive away. The castle and gardens are open to the public when the Royal Family are not in residence and 'Braemar' - home of the famous Braemar Highland Gathering, is approximately half an hour away by car/local bus. Ballater's very own 'Old Royal Station' was recently restored and re-opened after a devasting fire in 2015 but is once again a highlight attraction in our village. The library and tourist office are housed within this building, as is an exhibition area, Highgrove Shop and 'The Carriage' tearoom/bistro.  There is a regular Bluebird Stagecoach bus service that operates to/from the city of Aberdeen (approx 45 miles away), so even without a car, the village is easily accessable. Visit Ballater and explore a unique part of Scotland, and if you are looking for a  'home away from home' , then you won't be disappointed with a relaxing, pleasant stay at 'Inverey'.   We look forward to welcoming you!     end text_1 begin heading_2 end heading_2 begin text_2 end text_2 begin image_1 end image_1 begin heading_3 end heading_3 begin text_3 end text_3 begin heading_4 end heading_4 begin text_4 end text_4 begin link_1 end link_1 begin heading_5 end heading_5 begin text_5 end text_5 begin link_2 end link_2 begin image_2 end image_2 text here begin search end search PrintTracker Insertion Complete Google Analytics Insertion Begin Google Analytics Insertion Complete
