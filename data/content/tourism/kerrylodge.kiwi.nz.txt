Our property features large round picture windows (1.8m in diameter) reminiscent of homes in 'Hobbiton'. Breakfast and afternoon tea are served in our dining room where guests view the garden through one of these windows - or book the 'Eleanor' room for your accommodation which also features one of these windows.   Because it is one of the sunniest and warmest areas in New Zealand, Hawke's Bay is a wonderful place to visit and holiday in - with fabulous world class vineyards and stunning Art Deco architecture. We look forward to sharing it with you.   We are a member of the Bed & Breakfast Association New Zealand. This means we are quality assessed and meet the standards set by this Association. PS. We also have a rehomed Greyhound called Mumu. Mumu has free range of the back of the house but, much to her disappointment, she is not allowed in the guest areas.   close content close middle panel close col-sm-8 Search   ..../cache/kerrylodge.kiwi.nz//home-page//home-page?convert=modules&mod_step=1 - 2019-07-22 13:58:17 until 2019-07-22 17:58:17 secure host:"kerrylodge.kiwi.nz" Click to view our Bed & Breakfast Accommodation       Click to view our fabulous Garden Cottage for those looking for self catering accommodation.           Contact Us Phone +64 6 845 2317 stay@kerrylodge.co.nz 7 Forward Street, Greenmeadows, Napier, Hawke's Bay, New Zealand Your hosts Fiona and Brent Rollings       Original generation time 0.1631 seconds. close col 4 close row close container close main-content start footer - full width   © Kerry Lodge.
