This Southern Pines hotel has recently been the subject of a year-long multi-million dollar restoration, transforming it into the area’s only boutique hotel. The goal of the renovation was to create an environment in which our guests could experience the history and lifestyle of the pristine town of Southern Pines, while basking in comfort and service rivaling the nation’s top boutique hotels.  With fifteen luxury guestrooms and one-bedroom suites ranging in size up to 600 square feet, The Jefferson Inn offers such “comfort features” as cottage style furniture; plantation shutters; custom-made down-filled duvets and pillows; 600 thread count Egyptian cotton sheets; flat screen LCD or plasma TV’s in every room; in-room safes; and free wireless internet service. The generously sized travertine-clad baths feature authentic clawfoot and garden bathtubs, and oversized showers with regular and rain showerheads. Shortly after the restoration was completed, The Jefferson Inn was recognized by Conde Nast Johansens in its 2009 Edition of Recommended Hotels, Inns, Resorts and Spas in the Americas, Caribbean, Atlantic and Pacific. This honor is shared by only nine other properties in North Carolina. The Jefferson Inn, located just minutes from the Village of Pinehurst, is the Sandhills area’s only boutique hotel. We offer oversized and unique guestrooms and suites, one of the area’s finest dining establishments, and a popular tavern and outdoor courtyard including live entertainment seasonally. We offer golf packages and host customized mini-tournaments for your group, both including discounted rates and preferred tee-times at most of the area’s finest courses. Other customized packages are available and include weddings, tennis, equestrian, spa, wine tasting, shopping and more! .et_pb_text View The Jefferson Inn Galley Yes, Take Me There Press Alert: "Three Southern Towns Where trains matter to main streets" Click and scroll to page 58 for the Story Contact Us for More Information Click to drop us a line .et_pb_column Awards   .et_pb_text What a terrific experience and wonderful stay Great customer service and outstanding accommodations.

It’s full of history and charm. Rooms are spacious and the beds are heavenly. I loved the little extras the hotel staff provided. Fresh apples at check-in and a handwritten thank you note showing they valued me as a guest. Wonderful place!
