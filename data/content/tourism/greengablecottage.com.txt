That’s only a two hour drive from Los Angeles, San Diego and Orange County, a 90 minute drive from Palm Springs, and a 3 hour drive from Las Vegas. The Big Bear Lake Valley is the only Southern California area offering four-season recreation, with down hill and cross-country skiing, snow boarding, mountain biking, fishing, boating, sailing, water skiing, camping, off-roading, golfing, hiking, horseback riding, tennis, a zoo, museums and lots of shopping and good restaurants. Big Bear Lake with about 22 miles of shoreline is a breathtaking world of natural grandeur and clean alpine air. Many events are welcomed throughout the year including Oktoberfest, jazz festivals, Old Miner’s Days, car shows, mountain bike racing, antique and collectible shows, rodeos, and trout fishing derbies. There are plenty of evening activities; including karaoke, movie theaters, breweries, and a Performing Arts Center that features full Broadway plays and musicals. Cabin Location Our vacation rental cabin is located in Sugarloaf, which is just a few minutes south of Big Bear City off Maple Lane. Situated away from the busy downtown area, the numerous pine trees and fresh air reside among a beautiful and tranquil mountain atmosphere. Sugarloaf was given its name because of its location below the north slope of Sugarloaf Peak. At 9,952 feet, it is the highest summit in the Big Bear Area. row container locations-bar parallax map #content main // CONTENT FOOTER Follow Us Connect With Us Contact Us For Vacation RentalCabin Questions: Send Inquiry Or call and ask for John between 8AM-8PM PST : (949) 395-7166 Daytime (949) 459-7844 Evening Manager Login   Vacation rental software and secure online booking website by Vacation Rental Desk. ©2019 VacationRentalDesk.com. // container // FOOTER Smooth Scroll Include Date Range Picker Runtime JAVASCRIPT [if lt IE 8]> <link href="/css/templates/ie7.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" media="all" / <![endif] Make IE < IE8 behave like standards-compliant browser [if lt IE 8]> <script src="https://ie7-js.googlecode.com/svn/version/2.1(beta4)/IE8.js"></script> <![endif] PrettyPhoto Plugin Owl Carousel START Light Gallery Light Gallery Plugin Light Gallery Plugin END Light Gallery FlexSlider Plugins UI Latest compiled and minified JavaScript Waypoints All Scripts [if lte IE 9]><script src="js/script_ie.js"></script><![endif] Runtime CSS
