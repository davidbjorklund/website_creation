Georgian architecture, gracious hospitality, and savory and satisfying breakfasts are just the core of Anneâs White Columns Inn. Staying at Anneâs is like staying with friends. The comfort of our art and antique-filled rooms is always ready to welcome you, and an evening social is a relaxing way to transition from day to night. Upon entering through the columned portico, you will be greeted with a cheerful âWelcome home!â The crisp green and gray elegance of the foyer with its lofty ceiling at once offers a sense of quiet and calm. In the salon, the huge fireplace is crackling on those occasional cool days. Situated on private, gardened acres in the Historic Corridor of Bar Harbor, Anneâs is removed from the downtown bustle but still convenient to village activities and culture, as well as all that Acadia National Park has to offer. The large, sunny porch provides a peaceful setting for a leisurely breakfast, or for wine and cheese overlooking the bright jewel tones of the ever-changing gardens. We invite you to come home to Anneâs.
