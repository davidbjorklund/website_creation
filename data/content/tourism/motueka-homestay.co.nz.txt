Set in approximately 1.5 acres you can sleep in semi-rural peace, well away from the noise of traffic, and rise refreshed to enjoy the sunny Nelson/Tasman regions. The sea shore and Motueka sand spit are just a few minutes walk around the corner. The sand spit in particular is interesting for its importance to migrating waders, so if you're a bird watcher this is a great place to stay. Five minutes walk in the other direction brings you to Motueka High Street with its galleries, shops, cafés, bars, cinemas and restaurants. Motueka's 18 hole golf course is close by too, and welcomes visitors. And of course, Motueka is perfectly located between Nelson and New Zealand's Abel Tasman National Park, so make sure you enjoy a day trip into the park while you're here. The golden beaches and blue green waters invite you to wander. enddMain enddCont Motueka Homestay B&B I Bed & Breakfast I Self-contained Tourist Apartment I B&B gardens I Motueka & Nelson I Tariff & reservations Motueka Homestay Bed & Breakfast 186 Thorp Street, Motueka, New Zealand Your Hosts: Ian & Rebecca Williams Phone & Fax +64 (0)3 528 9385 Email: info@Motueka-Homestay.co.nz Website by We Do Websites enddFooter enddContainer
