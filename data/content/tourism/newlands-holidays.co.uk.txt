StoneyGill is the upper floor and StoneyAcre, the lower. The Byre is a large one bedroom detatched cottage set in a wildlife garden in the grounds of Stoneycroft. All properties are well- equipped and comfortable, and all have wi- fi and bed linen / towels included in rent. All have wonderful views to Skiddaw and Catbells and are ideal for both walking holidays and as a base for exploring the Lake District and a large proportion of visitors regularly return. Two classic âbig walksâ can be done from the doorstep (Coledale Round, Newlands Round) and it's a walk of just over ten minutes to the start of the Catbells walk, featured on TV's Wainwright's Walks. Maiden Moor, Dale Head, Grisdale Pike and Causey Pike can all be walked from the doorstep. Cot and highchair is available for each of the properties. Please note that we do not accept pets and there is no smoking in any of the properties. The Newlands Valley is a lovely part of the Lake District National Park, with wonderful views, direct access to the fells and yet only a short drive to Braithwaite and Keswick. We have four self- catering properties offering one bedroom, two bedrooms and three bedrooms. All are well- appointed, comfortable and attractive properties with central heating available for holiday rental in the heart of the Newlands Valley. Look at Reviews on TripAdvisor.
