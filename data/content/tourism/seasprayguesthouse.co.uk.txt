Seaspray is within easy walking distance of the town of Criccieth in Cardigan Bay, Wales. Criccieth is a beautiful small town situated on the shores of Cardigan Bay and sheltered by the Snowdonia Mountains. The history and heritage, which can be traced back to 1239, when a stone castle was originally built on a mound, which protrudes out to sea. The remains of the castle can still be seen and a walk to the top rewards you with fantastic views of the Town, the beaches and the mountains. The town received its charter as a borough in 1284. The centre of town is a green lawn ‘Y MAES’, which is part of the original Medieval Common Land and it is here that the four roads meet as a Crossing, one north to Caernarfon, one west to Pwllheli, one east to Porthmadog and one south to the sea. We are fortunate in that we have a very temperate climate and never experience extreme temperatures. Criccieth is particularly attractive in Spring and Autumn. Criccieth has a long fascinating history but has now developed into an interesting modern town, with an abundance of accommodation for tourists.
