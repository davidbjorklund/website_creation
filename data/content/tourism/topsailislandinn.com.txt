There is not a motel or hotel anywhere that will rent a room and then allow occupants of that room to invite others over. Your room is for you and ones you brought with you. It is not fair to other guests staying for some to bring 3-6 friends/family extra to use their room and the pool for the day. Visit on the beach or go to their house and visit with them. All it takes is for 2-3 rooms to do this and suddenly an extra 12-20 people in rooms and in pool. Thank you 202 Goldsboro Ave, Surf City, NC 28445   910-328-2341 Hours of Operation:  9:30ish AM- 6:00ish PM                                   Island Standard Time Did you know that privately owned motels have their rooms inspected by the county health dept? Chain motels do not have this requirement due to their "in house" training. We have stricter standards and guidelines to adhere to. Health dept only inspects the restaurant of a chain, if they have one, and their pool. Cool ceramic tiled floors continue the tropical ambiance inside of our quaint beach motel.  Queen size beds, refrigerators, microwaves, hairdryers, in-room coffee, remote control/color cable flat screen TVs, linens, and air conditioning/heat are included in all rooms.  Each room has its own picnic table outside.
