Learn the rules of the road and more here Frequently Asked Questions About Iceland If you're thinking of visiting Iceland, you might have a few questions. Check our FAQs below for some of the most popular queries. You can also find more detailed information in our Iceland Travel Guide and our attractions information pages. 1. Is it safe to travel to Iceland? Iceland is a very safe place to visit -- it’s a peaceful country with one of the lowest crime rates in the world. Iceland does have active volcanoes but eruptions occur once every four years on average. There’s also minor seismic activity on the island, but noticeable earthquakes are rare and the Icelandic Met Office keeps a good eye on such issues. Your dedicated, Iceland-based travel consultant will stay on top of these matters, as well as changing weather reports, to keep you safe on your journey. Don’t hesitate to ask locals for directions or advice either as Icelanders are used to travellers and tend to be helpful. 2. How long do I need to visit Iceland? The most important factor when planning your Iceland trip is how long you have to spend exploring -- fortunately our tours cater to suit a range of guests, from those who want an express four-day visit to those who want a leisurely two-week journey. The length of time needed really depends on your desired itinerary, the season, whether you want to travel off the Ring Road and how much time you want to spend in urban and rural areas. We often get asked whether a 7-day vacation will be enough time to see most of Iceland’s numerous sights and it is, but with so many attractions and areas to visit, we want you to make the most of your time and stay for as long as you wish. 3. What is the best time of year to go to Iceland? The best time to visit will depend on the attractions you want to see and areas you want to visit. For instance, the northern lights have higher visibility during the winter months and certain routes of the interior highlands are only accessible during the summer season. Iceland sees more visitors between June and August as the weather is milder and the days are longer but in recent years, the winter months have also been very popular with travellers coming to experience New Year’s and winter activities. 4. What are the best tours in Iceland? The best tour for you will depend on a range of preferences: the attractions and areas you want to see, the way you want to travel and the level of activity you want to partake in. A group tour may be an attractive option if you’re travelling by yourself or if you want a guide to show you the way, but if you’re travelling in a family or want to travel at your own pace then consider a self-drive tour or privately guided tour for more customisation. 5. What to pack for Iceland? Iceland is famous for its stunning natural beauty, but what’s lesser known is that its weather is quick to change and is as varied as the landscape, so make sure to pack smart and stay warm. We have a guide on what to pack, but as a general rule remember to bring: A lightweight jacket or wool sweater Waterproof jacket and trousers Sensible footwear with good grip Gloves, scarves and thermal socks A swimsuit and quick-dry towel Sunscreen and bug repellent in the summer months An insulated coat, thermal layers and long johns in the winter months 6. When and where can you see the northern lights in Iceland? The best time to see the northern lights is during the winter season between October and March. The reason for this is that during the winter months, the nights are dark enough to see them shine and flicker. For the best chance of viewing the lights, stay out past 8 PM and visit secluded areas away from the light pollution of the towns and cities, as darker conditions increase your chances of a sighting. 7. When is the midnight sun in Iceland? Iceland and the rest of the Nordic region experiences a natural phenomena called the “midnight sun” in the warmer months where the days are extended well into the evening. To experience this, you need to visit Iceland during the height of summer (from May to July). As a reference, the summer solstice is the longest day of the year and is on the 21st of June, so visit closer to this time to see and experience it. 8. Which is the best way to travel Self-drive or guided tours? The best travel style to suit you really depends on what experience you want. If you would like to see Iceland privately and at your own speed, then a self-drive tour is best. With a rented car you’ll have more opportunities to stop for photos at the viewpoints that aren’t always noted on the map. You also have more flexible timings and the freedom to go further afield for excursions and restaurants. On the other hand, if you’d rather sit back and let an expert tour guide show you the sights, then a guided small group tour could be ideal. On a small group tour you’ll be in the company of like-minded travellers, which is popular for our many solo guests and for our those who don’t feel comfortable driving in wintry conditions. They also get the bonus of a local Icelandic guide to share their knowledge and experience of Iceland. If you want to be accompanied by an expert driver/guide but want to customise your trip and set the pace, then a privately guided tour could be for you. This option blends advantages of self-drive and guided small group tours. You get to enjoy the personal one-to-one travel experience of a small group, but also keep the autonomy of self-drive tours. And it’s great if you’re travelling with family as you will have a personal guide to answer all your questions about Iceland. 9. Do I need a power converter for Iceland? Power converters may be required for small electrical appliances depending on where you’re visiting from as Iceland uses Northern European electrical standards (50 Hz/220 volts) and uses the standard Europlug socket with two round prongs. For these plugs you can use adapter types “C” or “F”. Appliances such as chargers for laptops, digital cameras or mobile phones, may already be compatible with multiple voltages and will just require travel adapter if not a Europlug. However, we do not recommend bringing a hair dryer from North America as the voltage difference may result in it getting broken or short-fused. Don’t worry though, many hotels have hair dryers in rooms. If you’ve forgotten to bring a converter or adaptor for Iceland, don’t worry -- you can buy them in Keflavík Airport, at electronic stores, souvenir shops, selected bookstores and some major hotels. 10. What language do people speak in Iceland? Icelandic is the official language of Iceland and it derives from a North Germanic language similar to Old Norse that has changed little since Iceland’s viking history. Most Icelanders know English though, since it’s a mandatory subject in primary schools, and many Icelanders are multilingual in other Nordic or European languages. You won’t need to bring a phrasebook, but if you want to learn some local lingo then here are some basic words and phrases to practise: Já = Yes  Nei = No  Góðan daginn / Góðan dag = good day  Gott kvöld = Good evening  Hæ / Halló = Hi / Hello  Bless = Goodbye  Takk = Thank you   About Nordic Visitor Nordic Visitor has been creating excellent travel experiences for customers in Iceland since it was established in 2002.
