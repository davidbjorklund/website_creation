The Flying Dog Ranch is situated at the base of imposing Mt Sopris in Carbondale, Colorado. It was home to the sacred hunting grounds of the Ute Indians. This ground remains sacred to us today. The land was bountiful, the air pure and the setting spectacular. It nurtured its inhabitants. The Ranch retains these characteristics today. The Utes thrived for centuries in the Roaring Fork and Crystal River Valleys and lived in harmony with nature, family and friends. We aspire to live the same.

Paul and I got married at the Flying Dog Ranch in June of 2009. We couldn’t have had a better location if created one ourselves. The flowers were beautiful and the veiw was amazing. Lydia was a pleasure to work with. It was as close to a fairy tale wedding as anyone can get. I would happily do it all again but I wouldn’t change a thing. ~ Lindsey 970-309-5256 Name * Email * Date of Event * Number of Guests 10-20 20-40 40-50 50-100 100-150 150-200 200+ Event Type * All Wedding & Reception Wedding Only Reception Only Yoga Retreat Corporate Retreat Private Party Are you interested in our event planning services?
