Guests may stroll easily along a nature path to our peaceful Pond Aawesome and Moosetrack Meadow, an expansive open valley with mountain views all around, natural landscaping and seasonal wildlife. Our wetlands connect via a natural corridor to the Chugach ("Chew-gatch") mountain range, which is home to black bear and moose, many of whom visit Pond Aawesome and the surrounding Moosetrack Meadow. Other wildlife includes a resident woodpecker, porcupines, the occasional brown bear, the elusive and rarely-sighted lynx, and a variety of wild birds, including the high-soaring eagle. Winter offers majestic fresh snow, ideal for cross-country skiing, making snow angels, snowshoe hiking and, energy-permitting, hiking up to the hill above the house for a fun run of skiing or snow boarding. Labyrinth The Chelsea Labyrinth was created to capture the rich experience of the thirteenth century Gothic Cathedral designs. Aawesome Retreat B&B has a 50 foot diameter labyrinth created from rocks gathered around Alaska. How about a walk in the midnight sun?   Read More Aawesome Retreat B & B Has Going Green!
