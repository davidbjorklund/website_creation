I don't know why anyone would go anywhere else on the island. Accommodations great, staff outstanding. A shout out to the staff who were delightful and always so willing to be of service. Even the hotel restaurant, which we didn't expect to be particularily good, was terrific and the staff there was also wonderful. We walked the beaches all over and the beach by Shell Island was the widest, prettiest of all. We were blown away by all of it! Love this Place! Mike D London, UK Shell island resort has beautiful views, clean rooms and a very private beach. Richard at the front desk was very helpful. Hollie at the restaurant was great. Her positive attitude is such an inspiration! It made my day. I'll stay again soon! Wedding & Reception Michelle F Watertown, NY We received excellent service from all employees. A special thanks to George and his staff. They provided us with assistance in setting up the wedding ceremony and reception. The rooms for our family and guests were very clean and user friendly throughout our time. Beyond Words! Barbie H I would highly recommend this hotel. The staff was friendly and very helpful with any and all our needs. The view was perfect of the beach and the Ocean. It was very clean and very quiet. Room service was a plus for our late night Teenagers and the breakfast bar was good for me so I could enjoy my stay and sleep a extra few minute's If I choose . Great Place to stay, Cant wait to get back!!! Getaway in Paradise! Laurie B. Pilot Mountain, NC Went here for a getaway and it was simply AMAZING!! The staff was wonderful and the room with the wonderful view was great!! We will be going back to this hotel every year now we just fell in love with it! Best Value, Location & Staff Anywhere DNA99 We have visited Shell Island in the past and it has always been nice, but this time it was FANTASTIC. The location is simply the best on the east coast, and hands down provides the best view of any hotel on Wrightsville Beach. The Resort sits at the end of the island so it seems a lot more private than other spots on the beach. Every room provides an awesome view of the ocean. But what makes this place Perfect is clearly the staff. From the front desk to the housekeeper who cleaned our room, everyone we encountered was super friendly and helpful. We will keep coming back!
