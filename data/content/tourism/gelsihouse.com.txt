Though the house is centuries old, all the plumbing and amenities are modern.  The kitchen is newly refurnished and comes fully equipped.  Gelsi comes with a large pool surrounded by beautiful views.  The house is located in the Umbria province of Italy, close to the town of Todi and 45 minutes drive from Assisi . Within a half-day's drive of Gelsi lie all the Southern Tuscan hill towns, and such centers as Siena and Arezzo. Gelsi is within a few hours drive or train trip from Florence and Rome.  Knowledgeable tourists know that Umbria is more beautiful than Tuscany, has fewer tourists, and is centrally located between Rome and Florence. website by hardenberghdesign.com
