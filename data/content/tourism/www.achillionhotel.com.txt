The manager was incredibly kind and allowed us to leave our luggage while we were travelling for one night in Meteora. Plus he gave us very good instructions to take a walk around the city. The room was clean and comfortable, good relation price/quality. The breakfast was the best!!! the greek pastry are really good and this hotel allowed us to taste them big time. GREAT experience!
