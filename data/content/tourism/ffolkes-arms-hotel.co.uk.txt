I'm just delighted I can say how perfect our day/evening was to them and our stay was fabulous and to end the Sunday morning with a lovely breakfast... We will be booking our room for their wedding too... Thank you to The Ffolkes team.. Kirsty you're a star. Jackie Bramham Great breakfast, highly recommended. My daughter loves the play area, great work! Stephen Blyth This hotel is very nice! This what many establishments should aspire to. It felt good to spend time here, especially for those of us who 'cross the pond' to get here. John Hitcham New menu great. Julie has had the lamb shank twice - perfectly cooked both times. I had the gammon steak, nice and thick so stayed beautifully moist, most of the fat removed - rest rendered very well. - Excellent Also tried the spam fritters - lovely light batter - not at all greasy - very good. Steak strips - very tender nice chilli kick Graham Rogerson Amazing venue, it's stunning. Great staff, location and superb for a wedding. Simon Rowe Third/last B&B during our trip. Don't think we would have stayed at the others if we had stayed with you first! EXCELLENT Sue Deane We are Norfolk Passport Partners, sign up for free online and save 10% on everything with us!
