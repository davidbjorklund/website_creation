Charming, calm, very clean, homely, just across the road from miles of beach (you can walk along the sea front a couple of miles to Hartlepool marina), yet on a quiet, rather quaint village green. There is a very relaxing, friendly atmosphere. The owners go out of their way to make you feel at home. I will certainly stay here again.
