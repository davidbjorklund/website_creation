In the restaurants and social areas, indoor spaces open to the outdoors, allowing for astonishing sightlines and enjoyment of the year-round gorgeous weather. Lounge by the pool, sip a cool tropical cocktail at the pool bar or enjoy superb cuisine and stunning views at the indoor/outdoor restaurant, where white tablecloths and candles create a truly romantic ambience in the evening.
