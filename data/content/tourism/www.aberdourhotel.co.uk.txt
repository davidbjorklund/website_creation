There are superior rooms in the former stable block which also has wheelchair access for the disabled.   The hotel has a superb reputation with locals and visitors for imaginative and creative Scottish cuisine. Our chef uses a fine range of fresh local produce which ensures that our customers have a memorable dining experience.   We are perfectly situated for golf breaks on some of the finest golf courses in Scotland as well as the many other tourist attractions that the East of Scotland has to offer.
