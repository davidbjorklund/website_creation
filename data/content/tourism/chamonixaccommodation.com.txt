Winter season accommodation For winter season accommodation then our clients come from all over the world. For those of you working in Geneva, we can find you a base to visit Chamonix every weekend with the minimum of responsibilities to deal with. You may wish for a studio or one bedroom to rent in Chamonix town for yourself and partner or a larger chalet where you can also entertain fiends and colleagues throughout the season. You may have a child taking part in the British Ski School and need accommodation for the winter season. Perhaps you can work remotely and need fast WiFi from your property. Chamonix Accommodation can help you find just about anything. You will find most of our seasonal apartments are located in the town centre itself as we understand that this is of primary importance to enjoy Chamonix's bars, restaurants and shops. However, you will find apartments in Chamonix Sud,, Chamonix Centre, Les Bossons, Les Bois, Les Houches, Les Moussoux, Les Pelerins, Les Praz, Les Tines and Argentiere. All our Chamonix apartments and chalets show up to date availability for the forth coming winter season. When the property has been booked you will find a 'Gone' banner on the photo. We have a long established relationship with all our seasonal owners and managers. If you are booking a property for the winter season then you will need to pay the entire rental upfront. This is where our adviser becomes very important. We can verify that each of our properties are of a good standard and we have long established relationships with all of our partnering owners and managers.

Just let us know what you need and we will send you our list of options with advice. It is very important to choose the accommodation in Chamonix that will suit your expectations. If you are not bringing your own transport then you need a chalet which is well served by the bus routes as well as having good accessibility to visit the town centre in the evenings and having some apres-ski after a day up the mountain. Either way, our accommodation advisers in Chamonix who have viewed the large majority or chalets in the valley can guide you to the best accommodation to suit your budget, group size, location preferences and services required. It is important to remember that our services in Chamonix are FREE meaning it will not cost any more to use our expert advisers. Location The question is which location should you choose from to enjoy Chamonix. This really depends on who will be in your group? If you are coming to Chamonix with children then we would advise staying in Les Houches or close to Les Savoys which leads to Les Brevents. For more advanced skiers then Les Grands Montets is one of the most challenging areas to ski so perhaps stay in Argentiere. This area is a very unique ski village with a good range of bars and restaurants and ski rental shops. Le Tour is another great ski domain and to stay here would be excellent though we would recommend bringing a car or booking a catered chalet. It's more quiet up here but if you like this tranquility then you'll love Le Tour. end introcontent <iframe src="https://snazzymaps.com/embed/156109" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe> end inner end intro Latest Listings Apartment Astoria 2 €10,000 end latestlisting Apartment Le Paradis €13,000 end latestlisting Apartment Franco Call for Price end latestlisting Chalet Falcon €42,000 end latestlisting Chalet Paul €38,000 end latestlisting Chalet Estelle €38,000 end latestlisting La Grand 22 €21,600 end latestlisting Chalet Charpoua €43,500 end latestlisting Chalet Ecureuil €35,000 end latestlisting Chalet Gros Pierrier €48,000 end latestlisting Grepon 4 €7,500 end latestlisting Cosy Taconnaz €8,000 end latestlisting end latest end inner end homerightcolumn end columnswrapper end inner end footer Copyright © Chilled Life Limited 2018   Browse by All Listings Features Bar Area BBQ and Garden Furniture Children’s Play Area Cinema Room Covered Parking Dishwasher En-Suite Bedrooms Film Library Fireplace Games Room Garage Garden Gym Hamman/Steam Room.
