Ponytails is a self-catering holiday cottage situated on a working farm in Poundstock, near the coastal town of Bude in North Cornwall. The farm and cottage were originally part of the historic, beautiful old Penfound Manor Estate, steeped in history dating back to the 12th century as mentioned in the Doomsday Book. The cottage captures a true rural feel and enjoys uninterrupted views over distant rolling countryside and overlooks a large lawn and orchard, which is often occupied by our Shetland pony Sugar and our new pony Annie, who will no doubt be waiting at the fence for treats. The well equipped single storey barn conversion can accommodate up to 4 persons, furnished to a high standard with the property reflecting its farm heritage. While on the farm you can enjoy a walk where you might see baby lambs and cows and calves in the fields.  There are also ancient woodlands full of wildlife for you to explore.  You can rent the property anytime from the April through to end of September, so come and escape to the countryside and enjoy a peaceful and relaxing holiday.  For up to date availability and prices, just click here.

' Ideal location within easy reach of beaches and town. Mr D Snape "Lovely cottage in a quiet countryside farm near Bude. Ideal location. Owners are very friendly. Cream tea waiting on our arrival. Excellent holiday. Mr R McCallum 'We received a lovely welcome at Ponytails and the cream tea which awaited us was very much appreciated after a long journey. We found the Lodge cosy but spacious with a lovely lounge and spacious bedrooms with plenty of storage. Our children loved the pony's in the field in the garden and fed them every day. The Lodge was very well equipped and we can honestly say we would thoroughly recommend it as a lovely place to spend a holiday out of or in season.'    Claire Logie Book Now For 2019 See 'Rates' Page For Availability Cornwall is one of, if not the most beautiful county in England.  Please come and spend your self catering holiday with us in North Cornwall at Ponytails, near Bude.  We look forward to seeing you soon!!   #EndEditable MSCellType="ContentFoot" home | property | rates | location | what to do | terms & conditions | site map | links | contact us MSCellType="ContentFoot" All materials on this site © myholidaycottagecornwall.co.uk
