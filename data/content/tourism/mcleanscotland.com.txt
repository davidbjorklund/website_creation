Our guests tell us you:Â Â  Arrive a guest, go home a friend! Hello My Friend â€“ We have had an amazing time! Everything was absolutely perfect! Mark was so much fun, he was so interesting and took us to a lot of out-of-the-way spots that were so beautiful. But then all of Scotland is beautiful. The guys really enjoyed the distilleries and Julie and I had a great time shopping and touring around. We spent time looking for dear and pheasants in the area fields as well. Fed the Highland Cows biscuits (one of my favourite activities). We really enjoyed Markâ€™s company, great sense of humour and comfortable manner. The B&Bâ€™s were beautiful, comfortable and the hosts so helpful and welcoming. The county house was incredible, I could have stayed for a week!Â  You did an amazing job, so patient with bumbling me, so reassuring and funny.Â  Cheers to all! Sue Fowler, Canada Cathy Cowan reviewed McLean Scotland â€“ 5 star â€“ Our tour with McLean Scotland was the highlight of our dream trip to the UK! The itinerary Liz created was fantastic and Andy (driver/guide) was so much fun to spend time with, giving us all the local insights, and always searching for ways to bring extra magic to our trip. For example, in Tobermory he found a fishing boat to take us (with our 12 year old son) out fishing for a few hours and then took us to the cutest farm for cheese toasties for lunch, a tour we will never forget! We never would have seen or learned so much about your beautiful country without you. Who We Are Paul â€“ Â owned and ran advertising agencies before tourism. He has aÂ  wealth of information . HisÂ passion for ScotlandÂ make him an ideal driver/guide. (He even makeâ€™s history interesting, says Liz!).Â  LizÂ  the organiser and a perfect hostess, she doesnâ€™t go on all the tours but when she does â€¦ itâ€™s memorable!Â  A dynamic duo Â and best friends. Scots are well known for their warmth and enthusiasm and both share a love for the country and aÂ passion for delicious drams. Our tour was better than a trip, it was an experience! And dad and I were lucky enough to have you and Paul as our knowledgeable and fun sidekicks.Â It was honestly one of the better trips Iâ€™ve ever had and the accommodations were great. Paul being our driver was fantastic â€“ enjoyable, stress-free, easy!Â  Probably one of the most underrated things about the experience, and your service offering, was that it was flexible! Dad and I felt like plans were malleable and could be changed. Both you and Paul did a great job encouraging us to make the most of our trip and we never felt rushed or pushed in any one direction.Â  Itâ€™s a trip dad and I wonâ€™t forget, ultimately thatâ€™s exactly what I was looking for â€“ a truly memorable experienceâ€¦ didnâ€™t hurt that we had some epic weather either ðŸ˜‰ Matt from California on theirÂ Whisky & Golf Tour Trebuie, or is it trying to make you buy a year or so that those.
