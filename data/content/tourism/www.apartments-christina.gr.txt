Two years ago we decided to change our appartment and found a new home in Christina. We feel more than comfortable there and enjoy the location, the personal atmosphere and the outstanding hospitality. We can highly recommend Christina Apartments to everyone. Rainer Hende We have just returned from three glorious weeks in Crete staying at the Christina Appartments. The location is superb with beautiful sea views and close proximity to all amenities in Panormo. We can thoroughly recommend the appartments, for their location, cleanliness and friendliness. Nothing is ever too much trouble for Markela and her mother. We are made to feel so very welcome as if we are family. Andrew and Maureen 17 years in greece and we always holidays in crete wast there the first hotel, than mararites, now that we panormo a very nice apartement in ckristina apartment with very simpatiek people,MARKELA,MARIEA,the mother,OLGA, and the whole family, we can highly recommend CKRISTINA APARTEMENTS to everyone De Roey Iâ€™ve been several times in this place which is although a place on earth it looks like a paradise. The amazing sunset, the unbelived sunrise the beatiful and warm village and the view to the sea are some of the things that the visitor find out within the first few minutes. Comming to the owners of this beatifull hotel the least comment that someone can make is that they make to fill home from the first moment of your arrival and giveâ€™s you the impression that you are part of thair family. By far best place to be and people to meet and rest, strongly recommended for people who love the sea the sun and can stand the love and the warm hospitality of the owners, Vaggelis Rozis We have been visited Cristina apartments in September of 2011. Itâ€™s the one of the perfect places and Markela and her family are so kind and friendly people. We love them so much. And we hope weâ€™ll meet them next year!!!
