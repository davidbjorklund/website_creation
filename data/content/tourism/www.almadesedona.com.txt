Welcome to Alma de Sedona Bed & Breakfast Inn Privacy… When first meeting with the architects to design Alma de Sedona, we were asked what design features were most important to us. “Views and Privacy” was the immediate response. Alma de Sedona provides an abundance of both. Every guest room has a separate entrance and either a large private patio or balcony framing your very own red rock views. Our rooms are designed to be enjoyed, with fireplaces and sitting areas, jetted tubs meant for two, separate showers (except in ADA approved Del Sol), and exquisite furniture and decor.  Come enjoy the small pleasure of lounging for hours by the seasonally heated pool appreciating the spectacular views, or experiencing the opulence of a king-sized bed dressed with plush pillows, down comforters, and custom designed duvets.
