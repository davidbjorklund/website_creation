"Just happened to find the Abbe House.  It was a great way to end a four day road trip through  Arkansas.  My wife and I felt like we were a part of the family and the food was out of this world.   The next time I travel that way I will take my fly fishing gear and stay for more than one night.   Thanks Mark for being such a great host."  -  Wibben, Shreveport, LA 5 Star Rating on Trip Advisor V oted #1 Best Inn Country for Outdoor Sports Enthusiast 2005  Country for Outdoor Sports Enthusiast 2004  Hunting & Fishing 2002   Readers of Inn Traveler Begin Tree The Abbé House Inn . 3144 Riverbend Road .
