So he created a hotel that makes the foliage and the flowers, the perfumes and the peaks, the sea and the bird song an integral part of your vacation experience. The estate encompasses 600 lush tropical acres bordering two soft sand beaches. Not only do you get a World Heritage Site anchored by the twin peaks on land, the resortâs two crystal-clear bays are part of a designated marine reserve protecting miles of colorful coral reefs teeming with tropical fish. With such a unique setting as his canvas, Nick Troubetzkoy was inspired to design a one-of-a-kind resort. He was committed to an environmentally conscious development before âgreenâ became fashionable. A dozen rooms are tucked in behind the coconut palms that line the beach and the remainder tiptoe up a flower decked hillside. To make the most of the panoramic views and the refreshing tradewinds octagonal whitewashed cottages come with wraparound flower draped balconies and louvered windows. Extra-large deluxe and premium suites underscore the visionary, innovative, sometimes whimsical side of Nick Troubetzkoy: in one suite, the balcony is built around a full-grown red gommier tree; in another a flamboyant tree drapes its red blossoms around the balcony. Some have their 4th wall open entirely to the vistas, yet are completely private. Anse Chastanetâs ever growing art collection provides a visual feast of its own. There are impressive wooden sculptures and plaques, earthy burlap compositions, painted âsky ceilingsâ and vibrant acrylic paintings invoking memories of Matisse and Picasso. And while the sensuous seclusion of the rooms provides some guests with the perfect excuse for lolling away the day on the balcony, others head out to partake in the many activities on offer; yoga, snorkeling, scuba diving, tennis, sunset sailing, sea kayaking or jungle biking, hiking and bird-watching among the ruins of an 18th century colonial plantation. The less actively inclined simply do nothing, lie on the beach or get pampered in the resortâs spa, Kai BeltÃ©. There is a casual beachside bar and restaurant; on the hillside, a panoramic hillside lounge and two treehouses provide the romantic setting for candlelit dinners, with musical backdrops by local entertainers. Tranquility, Romance and Adventure at Anse Chastanet. ANSE CHASTANET is St. Lucia's only resort property with the iconic view of both the Piti and Gros Piton mountains floating upon the Caribbean Sea. The location of the property is unsurpassed, a private estate of 600 lush tropical acres bordering two soft-sand Caribbean beaches with pristine coral reefs just offshore. The resort property includes the historical plantation of Anse Mamin and Emerald Estate where the resort grows its own organic produce.

I booked online and had never been to St Lucia before, I came expecting that the pictures online would be better than the reality but I couldn't have been more wrong. This resort has everything. I have never ever experienced hospitality as good! All of the staff are friendly, polite and so happy! The location is stunning, you have amazing views of the Pitons from all around the resort. I could see them both from my rooms balcony. I love St Lucia and I love this resort. Perfect for honeymoons and holidays. You couldn't ask for more from Anse Chastanet.
