Adventure travel is one of the fastest growing areas of the travel industry. It appeals to discriminating people who want to do something different, something involving more participation and activity.  Nature tours in Khao Sok National Park are our specialty. We are based in Phuket. Khao Sok National Park is 3 hours north of Phuket. We do not offer day trips to Khao Sok due to the distance and the fact that the park is so special. Check out our rave reviews on Trip Advisor . Khao Sok National Park is the absolute best jungle canoeing destination in southern Thailand. Khao Sok is part of a largest area of old grown protected area of mountains and jungle, with a 165 square kilometer reservoir. There is plenty of wildlife. Our goal is to show you the wonders of the natural world without impacting the ecosystems that we visit. We only offer small group tours. Most of our trips are two to four guests. Our maximum is eight. We use very stable, comfortable, and efficient traditional sit-inside touring canoes which are suitable for both beginners and experienced paddlers for our nature tours. No experience is needed for our self paddle Khao Sok tours. Khao Sok hosts many large mammals including wild elephants, Gaur, Tapir, deer, cats, wild pigs, and more . Also common in the park are White-handed Gibbons . This is a wonderful birdwatching destination. Check out these wonderful bird images . Khao Sok Floating Jungle Huts Staying in remote floating bungalows in Khao Sok National park, we paddle out to quiet coves and witness the movement of birds and wildlife in their natural environment. You create a bond with nature when you sit still. You absorb the rhythm of life itself. The floating bungalows are owned and operated by the national park system. They can get rather noisy. Jungle Survival Training You can participate in a Jungle Survival Course in Khao Sok. Budget-minded Survival Training is available in Phang Nga Province . If you want to experience the jungle of southern Thailand, Phang Nga Province costs less to visit, offers camping (it's illegal to camp in Khao Sok), is much closer to Phuket , and the jungle is just as impressive as the jungle in Khao Sok National Park. There are also many stunning creeks and waterfalls in Phang Nga Province. Khao Sok Hiking Trails We also offer hiking to special locations. Creek hiking routes offer an easy way to see the thick jungle. Kayaking is still a much more productive way to see wildlife than hiking through the tropical jungle. Animals tend to flee from people walking in the jungle.  They don't seems as bothered by paddlers. Thailand Rainforest Contrary to popular belief, Khao Sok is not a true rainforest , but a tropical evergreen forest or tropical monsoonal forest. Photography - Wildlife & Scenery If you are into wildlife or scenery photography, Khao Sok is going to make you very happy. With each hour of the day, the changing light brings forth opportunities for amazing photos. We have a lot of really nice wildlife images on our Paddle Asia Pinterest site.   Wild Elephants We see wild elephants on many of our trips. Here is a photo of two elephants, an adult and a youngster playing in the water. They didn't seem to mind that we were watching them. We kept our distance, because we didn't want to disturb their playtime. It was a show that we will never forget. Click here to see more elephant images .

Our first trip out on Saturday evening we saw 2 elephants and another two showed up and got in the water for a swim. We had to back up the kayak. It was incredible. Anyway, on the different trips over the 4 days, we also saw a barking deer, (and heard it bark.) We saw at least 3 different hornbills including a group of 5 or so great hornbills.. We saw sun bears 3 times and I have great video of those. And we saw dusky Langurs, macaques and gibbons. We saw a pair of woodpeckers. I forget their exact names but they are beautiful. The male has a red crest and is black and white and the female is more yellow colored. And if I remember right there is a great whatever woodpecker and a common whatever woodpecker and we saw the common ones. We saw osprey, gray-headed fish eagles, Asian airy bluebirds and an owl. And yesterday we saw, although not very clearly, a wild boar. At the bathhouse I saw a 4 foot monitor lizard and I am unsure who jumped further." Follow and subscribe to our blog . Our sister sites.
