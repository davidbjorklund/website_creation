The old caves, which used to be rooms for the pilgrims, a winery and stables have been restored and converted to attractive apartments. The combination of the well preserved church and the white walls of the vaulted rooms in its courtyard create a peaceful meditative monastic feel and the serene atmosphere is an oasis of relaxation. Located at the east coast of Santorini island 1,5 kms after Vourvoulos on the eastern road to Oia , and only 4 km from the capital town Fira, Aghios Artemios is offering a magnificent view over the sparkling waters of the Aegean. Watching the sun rise from the sea horizon is an unforgettable experience. Not far from Aghios Artemios the guests can enjoy the quiet beaches of Pori, Kolumbo and Baxedes. Apart from the residential use of the resort, it can be combined with wedding and baptism arrangements, seminars, cultural exhibitions or fashion activities, or any other event which requires large indoor and outdoor facilities.
