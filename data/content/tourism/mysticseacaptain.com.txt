We are interested in your Inquiry. About Ann and Rick We enjoy sailing. We love to garden & enjoy the variety of trees, shrubs & flowers we are able to grow. Why we chose the Connecticut Shore.  We fell in love with this wonderful house, expect guests will love it too. The historic and architectural character of the town and its buildings held a special appeal to two architects whose practice has focused on the restoration of historic properties, commercial and residential, for 30+ years. Restoratiion began in 1997. The house is in a protected historic district filled with a variety of well preserved early homes and the village maintains its character as one built on seafaring and boat building. We have a chance to practice our horticultural skills on a garden rather than the roof of our townhouse. However, there never seems to be enough room for all the trees and shrubs we admire.  Mystic is conveniently located and on the Boston/NY Amtrak line. It is wonderful, friendly village with all the requisite services and offers many opportunities for relaxation and intellectual stimulation. Of course, the Mystic Seaport Museum (just a mile walk through the village and across the river) and ready access to to the great sailing waters in the environs were a great draw to us as well. We love to share the 1853 Captain Wheeler House with guests who will care for it while they explore and enjoy what the area has to offer. What makes this house unique. One seems never to have enough time to do what they choose to do while visiting because there is such a great choice. Our home has particular appeal to multi-generation family gatherings for a number of reasons. It seems guests love to congregate at the house or in the garden visiting and reading and then go off in different directions pursuing a selected activity be it fishing, walking, antiquing, choosing a beach, biking, birding, or attending one of the many local events at the Mystic Seaport Museum or in town like the Taste of Mystic or the annual Mystic Outdoor Art Festival. It is big enough to offer comfortable accommodation with 5 bedrooms, each with private bath, plus the cupola. It is also a short walk to the village so different age groups can roam at ease without relying on a car. Parents can take young children to the playground while others shop or just relax.  Couples on annual getaways also like to visit and take Vineyard tours, try the many restaurants, visit the nearby museums, take a day trip to Block Island. We enjoy sharing 1853 Captain Wheeler House with guests who appreciate historic houses and visiting a seaport village in a region which offers a rich history, culture, nature, water and other activities. . . .  Mystic is a desired location for Weddings with many venues from wineries to historic locations. Abundant year round recreational options. 1853 Captain Wheeler House is ideally suited for reunions and family gatherings.
