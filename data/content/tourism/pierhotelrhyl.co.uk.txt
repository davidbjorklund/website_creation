We stayed yet again at the pier hotel, we have stayed here many times beforehand. This hotel is clean, comfy, the breakfasts are amazing, the hosts are really friendly. Would be nice if the breakfasts were a bit later as you are on holiday for the weekend. Apart from that excellent hotel, would recommend to anybody going to stay in Rhyl. Tricia Great place right on the sea front. I was there for work, the room was clean and really well presented, the Wifi strong and the breakfast was the best I've had for a long time. Together with friendly staff, I can't recommend strongly enough Craig We're regulars at the Pier, we would never stay anywhere else when visiting Rhyl. As always, the room was great, the service was fantastic and the breakfast was lovely. Whenever we tell people we're staying in Rhyl, we don't say "We're staying at a hotel" we tell them "We're staying with some friends, who run a hotel" as we're always made to feel like we're family. It was lovely to see you both again, Wayne & Will - looking forward to coming back again later in the year. Lea Just got back from a 3 night stay with my sister. We had a lovely time, adults only which is a bonus in a B&B, lovely cosy twin room, quiet but with added touches such as a hair dryer and iron and ironing board, mini bar at very reasonable prices. Breakfast was outstanding, freshly cooked to order really tasty. Tina All in all I would highly recommend staying here as I know if I was to stay in Rhyl or the local area again I would book to stay here again no second thoughts at all..!!
