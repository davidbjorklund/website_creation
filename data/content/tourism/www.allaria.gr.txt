The town was well-known for its coins, mostly for those of the third and second century BC , as well as for some signs, which refer to the treaty of friendship signed between Allaria and Paros. The inhabitant ,according to the signs,was called “Allariotis”. That story  was the inspiration of our villa's name. The first time that you visit the village of “Stavromenos” you might have the idea that you are in the middle of nowhere! On the contrary, you are only a few minutes away from some of the best beaches and sightseeing in Crete. 15 min. away from the sandy beaches of Panormo, 25 min from the city of Rethymno, 10-20 min away from “Margarites”, a well known village for its tradition in pottery and art. “Ancient Eleftherna”, with the new built museum or the famous monastery of “Arkadi” are some of the places that the owners will advise you to visit, according to your interests. End Entry Entry Museum of Ancient Eleftherna end flexi Museum of Ancient Eleftherna The Museum of Ancient Eleftherna is worth a visit for discovering and feeling the ancient history of the area. It is the first museum inside an archaeological site in Crete, as it is located next to the archaeological site of Eleftherna. The three halls of the museum host the whole history of Eleftherna from 3000 BC to 1300 AD with everyday objects and artworks. It is a modern building opened in 2016, approximately 1,800 sq.m. which together with the surrounding area occupies 3 acres and remotely resembles ark that emerges from the earth, gazing Ida (Psiloritis). It is divided into two wings with the right one on the ground floor for hosting the guards - ticketing area and the Study Centre in the left area of ââthe exhibition halls of the museum. The architectural project was designed on a human scale, related to the natural environment, while at the same time as modern edifice is absolutely distinct and recognizable of the era in which it was created. The large surrounding area in front of the museum features gardens and tree planting small parking for people with disabilities and especially paved surfaces with special provisions. In large wide in space on the east side of the museum has formed a natural outdoor theater for the holding of events and for the enjoyment of nature. Everywhere there are trees, plants and herbs typical of the Cretan flora from antiquity to the present day which is also the perfect atmosphere to walk around. End Entry Entry Archaeological site of Ancient Eleftherna end flexi Archaeological site of Ancient Eleftherna Eleftherna (Greek: ÎÎ»ÎµÏÎ¸ÎµÏÎ½Î±), also called Apollonia, was an ancient city-state in Crete, which lay 25 km southeast of Rethymno. Archaeologists excavated the site, located on a narrow northern spur of Mount Ida, the highest mountain in Crete. The site is about 1 km south of todays Eleftherna, in the current municipality of Rethymno. It flourished from the Dark Ages of Greece’s early history until Byzantine times. The city was founded by the Dorians in the 9th century BC. Current archaeological evidence shows that Eleftherna was one of Crete’s most important ancient cities, a capital city of the Geometric and Archaic periods – that is, the periods when the Homeric poems were disseminated and recorded in writing. According to tradition, the city was named after Eleutheras, one of the Kouretes, who protected the infant Zeus by beating upon their bronze shields thus preventing his father Cronus from hearing his cries and devouring him. Since 1985 The University of Crete makes systematic excavations each summer and the findings so far are many and impressive. The discovery of a double tomb over 2,700 years old which hid more than 3,000 sheets of gold and the first depiction of the bee as a goddess is one of the most important excavations.
