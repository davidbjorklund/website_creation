This closure will require that existing bookings be refunded and/or placed with other operators. Outstanding payments already received will be refunded by return transfer. For rebooking and for new bookings during the closure period, for scuba clients we recommend Uepi , should Uepi be fully booked for your itinerary dates we recommend Oravae , with diving provided by Dive Gizo . For clients looking for Marovo ecolodge experience, we recommend Matikuri . This has been a very difficult decision to make as Wilderness provides a unique stream of sustainable income and humanitarian support to a great many Marovo people, and the broader Marovo economy. However, the lack of bookings for the past year has made it impossible to sustain operations, even with drastic cost-cutting measures and reallocation of work roles. Rates for 2019-20 bookings will be emailed out shortly. We thank you for your ongoing support, and look forward to sharing the unique Wilderness adventure experience in 2019 and beyond. Thanks and best regards, Waelinah, Corey and the Wilderness team <h1>welcome !</h1> <p>Situated on a coral lagoon on Gatokae Island at the southeastern tip of the Solomons' Western Province, the wilderness lodge offers unique access to the rich natural and cultural world of Marovo Lagoon.</p> <p>Catering for a maximum of 12 guests the private Wilderness Lodge has been designed to meld the atmosphere of the Gatokae rainforest, ocean, and neighbouring small village with Western comforts and convenience.
