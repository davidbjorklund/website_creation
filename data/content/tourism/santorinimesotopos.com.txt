Flora and Konstantina are the most resourceful and pleasant hosts ever. Stayed here for 3 nights, they made our stay enjoyable and memorable. We got Flora’s homegrown cherry tomatoes and cucumber. Konstantina helped us with the transportation and cruise bookings. The room offered just exactly what you need, and a balcony to enjoy the sunrise. Everything was clean and tidy. The location is a bit outside the city centre of Fira, which means that you can expect quite sleeps at nights. Will definitely stay here again. – Verna Winarni Happy customer END VISITORS TESTIMONIALS Very nice place with charming and clean studios. The staff members are very helpfull and incredibly friendly.
