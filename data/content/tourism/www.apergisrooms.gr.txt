One of its basic advantages is that it is quiet, not affected by the sounds of the city, even though it is situated in its center. Ermoupoli can entertain all sorts of guests with: hotels, neoclassical guesthouses, rooms for rent and apartments that can provide any service requested: restaurants with traditional delicacies, the little ouzo places, the Casino which operates daily all year round, bars which are frequented by the youth and foremost Syrians are noted for the hospitality and will make you feel "at home". All of this will surely impress you and you feel the need to revisit our island. We will anticipate your return to offer our hospitality again and attend to you in the same fashion you have been accustomed to. Departing from the island of Syros along with the beautiful memories, do not forget to buy some of our famous "loucoumia" and our delicious "halvathopitas". And don't forget to try our celebrated cheese "San Michali".        END RIGHT CONTENT END CONTENT WRAPPER END TEMPLATE WRAPPER SOCIAL NETWORK MODULE © 2013 Apergis Rooms Syros | Κατασκευή ιστοσελίδων ξενοδοχείων END COPYRIGHT Links END FOOTER MID END FOOTER begin olark code Questions?
