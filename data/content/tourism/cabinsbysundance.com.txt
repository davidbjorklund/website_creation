Blue Ridge cabin rentals near the Toccoa River The serene Toccoa River flows north for nearly 100 miles and eventually crosses the border from Georgia into Tennessee. As the Toccoa meanders through North Georgia through Blue Ridge, it provides wonderful opportunities for trout fishing, kayaking, and tubing. If you’re a water-lover, consider booking a Blue Ridge cabin rental on the banks of the Toccoa River. When you're outside your cabin enjoying the open fire pit into the early evening, or drinking your cup of morning coffee along the river bank, you, too, will discover a special friendship with the Toccoa River.
