Pamukkale was breathtaking, and Cappadocia with its cave hotels, fairy chimneys and underground cities was magical.    We loved our small group of six and had a fantastic guide in Ensar Islamoglu and an excellent driver in Yuksel Topal.  Ensar was intelligent, knowledgeable about the history and mythology of Turkey and extremely entertaining with his unique stories and little known facts.  Yuksel was on a par with our driver in Jordan, one of the best we have had.  We always felt safe with Yuksel at the wheel.   Greece  is a perfect companion to the Turkey tour complete with its own unique history, the Acropolis, the Aegean and Ionian   Seas  and the islands.  Ending a three week tour with relaxing visits to Mykonos and Santorini was ideal.  The hotels could not have been better, even with all the steps.  Your choice on Santorini, right on the cliffs overlooking the Caldera was superb.  And the sunsets were unbelievable, the pictures do not do them justice.   In closing, we can only say that Anatolia has done it again, providing us with another amazing and memorable adventure.  We will continue to recommend you highly.  We have attached a few photos and hope you enjoy them.   Warmest Regards,   Gary and Karen Neet   / Colorado   MSCellType="ContentBody"   MSCellType="ContentBody"   MSCellType="ContentBody" Anatolia Tours & Travel is proud to sponsor and provide travel services for TV Show "Word Travels" Turkey episode To view full episode click here A natolia Travel Blog Recent Posts Top 10 Tips to Travel Light Follow the Hollywood Scenes in Turkey Tips for Untouristy Tourists: Istanbuls Hidden Treasures Discover Wonders of Egypt and Jordan Find Your Travel Style: Group Tour Or Private Tour?
