Read review on Trip Advisor My wife and I took our adult daughter on a two-day visit to Whidbey Island where we discovered the Anchorage Inn. It was perfect for us. We had the large third-floor "Crows Nest" that offered us plenty of room with an extra roll-away bed. The wrap-around deck was a great place to relax and enjoy the scenery. The breakfast was lovely. It was wonderful experience. Read review on Trip Advisor Lovely inn and very friendly, helpful innkeepers! A quiet little town with a few interesting points and good restaurants. Try the walk up Main Street, right at the art institute, through the woods and down to the water; then return along the beach. Read review on Trip Advisor The Anchorage Inn has the perfect location in Coupeville. It is within walking distance of many great restaurants and has a lovely view of the water.
