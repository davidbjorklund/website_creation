The cottages offer comfortable and relaxing accommodation for your holidays in Crete. Access to the cottages is quite easy. When you arrive at Paleochora, you see on the left side of the road, an old hotel (Libycon) & the sign for the Camping Area. If you follow the east coast that skirts Paleochora's pebble beach, passes the churchyard & campside, then leaves the coastline & you can just, catch a glimpse, of the tilled roofs of the Cottages. They are peeping out, between green Olive Trees on the far side of the river bed & framed by the endless blue vistas of the Libyan sea.! This small complex has enormous character & located between Olive trees to provide maximum shade & privacy. The Cottages have been designed & construct by the owners, Georgia & Thomas, as that is their main business. description aio-icon-box aio-icon-component Â Olive Tree Cottages Awards description aio-ibd-block aio-icon-box aio-icon-component .four-columns - sidebar mfn_hook_content_after mfn_hook_content_after #Footer Information Home Cottages Location / Surrounding Places Activities Travel Information Reservations Recent Blog Posts Other Activities Wild & Unique Flora Tranquil Surroundings Secluded Beaches Ancient Ruins & Churches Windsurfing Snorkeling Contact Info Address: Paleochora, Chania, Crete Telephone / Fax: +30 2823041792 Mobile: +30 6976731156 Email: info@accommodation-crete.com Copyrights #Wrapper mfn_hook_bottom mfn_hook_bottom wp_footer() ngg_resource_manager_marker
