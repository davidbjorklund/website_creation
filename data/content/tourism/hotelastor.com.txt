Life in South Beach’s Art Deco District is peppered with vintage hotels and modern revelry, by beach-goers bathed by the warm waters of the Atlantic and buildings bathed by warm sunset light. South Beach’s Art Deco district is also the erstwhile playground of the beloved and terrifically fictitious social ambassadors, The Astors. The Hotel Astor is made in their vision–one of relaxed tropical ease, leisurely breakfasts and social engagements that leave you tingling. One where phones are intended for light gossiping, the only thing quick are the witticisms, and nothing is easier than life itself. Mr. and Mrs. Astor believed in the good of all people–and believed in making them slightly better with a few stiff drinks and some leading questions. And so we approach every decision at the Hotel Astor with this question: what would The Astors do? We honor our fanciful brood with a hotel awash in art deco charm, by creating a life that is alive, whether at our deco-era pool, in our sumptuous restaurant, or our easy cocktail lounge. Nobody deserves to live a life that is ordinary, but certainly not those who choose to stay at the Hotel Astor. Here’s to you, Astor Clan.
