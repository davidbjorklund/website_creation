Built in 1901, it has been lovingly restored but with the addition of up to the minute technology for comfort and convenience. It’s the title shot in Geoff Murphy’s Kiwi classic movie Goodbye Pork Pie. Our Kauri staircase dazzled in Don Selwyn’s beautiful film Maori Merchant of Venice. In 2004, the BBC film Not Only But Always stars Braemar (alongside Rhys Ifans of Notting Hill fame). Where flyer Jean Batten’s father Fred had his apartment upstairs is now our main guest suite. All our guest rooms are upstairs on the 1st floor and are tastefully furnished with a mixture of the old and new. The Batten Suite, with ensuite bathroom and private tv lounge, and the Victorian room with an insuite bath and toilet, both have open fireplaces. Our Norman and Jenny rooms share a bathroom and are often booked as one unit.    .et_pb_text .et_pb_column All our bathrooms have restored old style large clawfoot baths which are superb for relaxation and pampering. All toiletries are complimentary and we endeavour to offer the finest New Zealand made products available. The ground floor (street level at the front) has a front parlour and a large lounge, both available for your relaxation. Wireless broadband is available throughout the house, but if you want to go online and didn’t bring your own laptop, you can go wireless with ours. The dining-room where you come for breakfast is located on the lower ground floor. Being located by Auckland University means that cinemas, theatres, cafes, restaurants, the Skytower, the Ferry Buildings, the railway and bus stations, the Vector Arena and ASB Tennis Courts are all just a short walk away. We share our home with a toy poodle named, Tina. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section A Home Away From Home A Unique Bed & Breakfast .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row  Auckland .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column  5 Rms, 10 Guests .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column  Full Breakfast Every Morning .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb .et_pb_column Book Now .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section text .et_pb_column text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner text .et_pb_column text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section Discover Room & Suites Treat yourself or someone you love to a stay in our restored late Victorian townhouse in the Auckland Central Business District, close to the heart of Auckland City.
