The customer service I received was just excellent! It was such a pleasant stay too, all of my colleagues agree with me when I say that. When we got there, we met with a lovely lady who showed us our apartments and told us all the local restaurants and visiting areas. The apartment was just lovely too! I highly recommend <a href="" class="h-rew-link">Read more ...</a> / block block <div class="h-rev-portrait"><img src="/storage/users/no-photo.png" /></div> Brad Cocinero 12 October 2017 Best Place To Stay In Amsterdam Stayed in the Chill apartment with 4 friends ... Perfect location.. few minutes walk to the Dam square and next to the infamous red light district.

Everything went as we had hoped and the apartment was - modern, clean, warm, well equipped, everything worked, and we could smoke in the apartment - plus, the location was fantastic in terms of being in a central location with access to almost everything in the immediate vicinity. <a href="" class="h-rew-link">Read more ...</a> / block block <div class="h-rev-portrait"><img src="/storage/users/no-photo.png" /></div> Maria Delacourt 02 July 2017 Great Communication We just want to say we had a great time staying with Amsterdam Escape. From the moment we booked to the time we checked out the service we received was outstanding. They offer a level of customer service that cannot be beaten, I have booked with AirB&B, booking.com and many others and trying to contact with a living talking human at their customer service is impossible. Will use Escape again without hesitation. <a href="" class="h-rew-link">Read more ...</a> / block block <div class="h-rev-portrait"><img src="/storage/users/no-photo.png" /></div> Anthony Jacobs 20 March 2017 Amazing Apartment in Amazing Amsterdm My girlfriend and I just returned from Amsterdam. We stayed with AmsterdamEscape in their Snug apartment. This little romantic studio looked great and very unusual and it lived up to our expectations. On our arrival, we were met by Mo who showed is int the basement studio, it's down a few steps in the basement. The Snug is a pretty special place, has a lovely colour scheme and a huge very comfortable bed. <a href="" class="h-rew-link">Read more ...</a> / block block <div class="h-rev-portrait"><img src="/storage/users/no-photo.png" /></div> Eddie A. 26 September 2016 More Than Expected The greeter was a gentleman, the place was great, safe quiet everything a stoner wants in a short vacation, I personally would love to stay here again more than the 8 days which we stayed initially thx for everything <a href="" class="h-rew-link">Read more ...</a> / block / slide / slider Read more reviews on TripAdvisor Read more reviews on Trustpilot / END HOME - / end wrapper - FOOTER - Apartments F.A.Q.
