The coach came 5 minutes before our pickup time informed by office, but Roy patiently waited for us as we had some elderly parents  in our group He kept taking extra care of our parents and that was very assuring as their English language was not the best. Pinnacles desert is an amazing place & we felt like we were on a different planet. very well organised and lots of fun and easy time all along. Had good fun. End review strip A Yeo Loved this holiday and find it hard to pick any fault: Organisation is excellent from start to finish and the guide travels is very friendly. End review strip Wendy Tay Our family of 4 signed up a half day penguin island tour with glass bottom cruise add-on. Other than cute penguins, sea lions and a wild elephant seal with her pup, the most wonderful was up close encounter with a school of wild dolphins!! We were thrilled!! Also Mark, our driver cum commentator was awesome too. He is very professional and friendly. He is fun and cracking jokes along the way. Thanks for this wonderful experience! End review strip Jernaz G I took a tour to Margaret river with Aussie Perth tour & had good fun. There was so much to see there. Wish had more time to stay overnight. Loved the caves underground, very old caves, very pleasant peaceful and cool. End review strip See all reviews Get started with Aussie Perth Tours Want to get started booking your next tour?
