I cannot thank management and staff enough for their awesome understanding and support during my ten day stay, the last 2 weeks have been very stressful wondering if my son was going to be ok after a horrific car accident however you all made me feel comfortable and at home. The rooms are very comfortable and clean and I would not hesitate to return. ‚Äú Kath H - Tripadvisor, August 2018 Great Rooms and Staff ‚ÄúThe staff were friendly and very helpful. The rooms were clean and comfortable and it was a lovely view from our balcony üôÇ We were happy with the on site parking. A short stroll to everything/everywhere.‚Äù Lorraine - Booking.com, July 2018 Perfect Location ‚ÄúPerfectly located for our trip to the footy, just a leisurely 10 minute stroll to Adelaide Oval and literally on the doorstep of everything that North Tce offers.

Will not hesitate to stay again on my next visit to Adelaide.‚Äù Beau - Booking.com, July 2018 Excellent Friendly Staff ‚ÄúEverything was clean. Size of the room was great.
