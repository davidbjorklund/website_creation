Capturing all day sun, the house sits in a mature garden and looks over a canopy of trees to stunning views. These range from the immediacy of yacht races in the Nelson harbour, across Tasman Bay to Abel Tasman National Park and the Mt Arthur Range. The owner of the original house, James Cross, was Nelson’s first harbourmaster and could keep an eye on the ships coming in and out of Nelson Harbour. The present house built of native timbers by James Cross’ daughter, dates from 1901. There is an outside staircase for your private entrance and off street parking.
