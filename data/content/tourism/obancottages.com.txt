As we are only 3 miles outside Oban "The Gateway to the Isles" its a perfect base for visiting the Highlands and the Islands. A bit closer to home we are only half an hour away from Kilmartin Glen with its Neolithic Standing Stones and Carnasserie Castle. Take a drive over the Atlantic Bridge and you will find yourself off the Scottish mainland and onto the Isle of Seil with its conservation area and old slate mining town Ellenabeich. 16 Columns End Container / End Testimonials Slider Thanks Jim for letting us stay in your house. We had a fantastic weekend despite being consumed with rain! The house was ideal for us, clean and spacious with a great big enclosed garden. A8Ree We just had a week in this cottage and found it very comfortable and a handy point to see this beautiful part of the world. Lots to see and do from here and its lovely when the sun shines, make sure you travel around so much to see. Mick & Sally I stayed with my family. During our scotland trip we stayed at multiple places including this one. I would rate this one best. Cottage was clean and presented well. I would recomment strongly. My observation , if you are going to use Sat Nav, follow Jim's recommendation.
