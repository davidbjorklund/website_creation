Receptionist was helpful in finding an open dinner spot for us, and breakfast was good in the Deli. We were there in mid-October and the town was closing up for the winter including this motel. When planning your road trip, check to make sure lodging properties, restaurants, and services are open for your dates. Also, we bought a bagged lunch at the deli. It was good we did as this was the closest town to Capitol Reef for services. “Friendly Spot but Closes Seasonally” This sweet lodge is so cozy, clean and neat, that we were almost sad we only stayed two nights. The rooms are spacious, although most of them are equipped with two queen beds. I understood they have only one room with a king-size bed. It didn't matter to us since the Queens were big enough for us to fit in together easily. The room looked like it was renovated not too long ago. WiFi, fridge and TV all worked well. We always went to the little deli in the shop that belongs together with the lodge for breakfast. And the shop has everything you need (also a broad variety of beer). It's not far from the national park and there are quite a few dining opportunities around. But you'll need a car. From our three week road trip through the US I enjoyed this place the very best. “Simply perfect!” We booked Austin's based on the reviews on Tripadvisor and were not disappoineted. The receptionist was very friendly and efficient. We stayed in a new motel room on the 2nd floor. The rooms have a standard motel decor but they are new, spacious and well equipped. There is a nice pool (pool towels provided at the front desk). The general store sells everything you need. We were not impressed by the deli, they had problems handling the breakfast orders and the food was just OK. There is very little room to sit so we took our breakfast back to our room. All in all a good place to stay for a very decent price, finally a lodge that doesn't overcharge just for the location. “Good place to stay just outside the park” This place has a little bit of everything, a true general store. This part of Utah is somewhat remote and if you are in need of most any item Austin's has you covered. The staff was friendly and the store was clean. We did not stay at the lodge but if in the area again we will based on the amenities on site.     “General store when you need it most!” .end resp-wrap About The Chuckwagon .entry-header Your Capitol Reef Adventure starts here at The Chuckwagon.  GO PLAY!
