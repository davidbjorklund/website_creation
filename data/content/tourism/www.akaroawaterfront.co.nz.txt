At high tide, the sea was just six meters from the unit, directly across a neatly-trimmed lawn. It is the most peaceful and relaxing location Iâve ever encountered at a motel in New Zealand. Also just a one to two-minute walk from the supermarket and town centre, and a 10-minute walk from more restaurants and cafes near the main wharf. Beautifully refurbished, spacious, and well appointed. I cannot wait to return. Alli A Awesome spot Reviewed 20 May 2019 Last night of our South Island trip was spent here in a ground floor studio apartment, absolute waterfront and close to quite a number of shops/bars/eateries. Check in was a breeze and the room was clean and tidy. Heater was warm, shower nice and hot. Sky Tv was an added bonus. Would definitely stay again if in the area, for longer next time. Darren C Great Location Reviewed 25 Apr 2019 Thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this motel. The ground floor room fronted the harbour and I enjoyed watching the bird life and sunsets over the water from the warmth of the lounge. Well equipped and very functional and would stay again. Steven "A great stay and we look forward to coming back soonâ Reviewed 29 Apr 2018 Fantastic location, an easy walk to everything. Heaps of activities for the kids, like outdoor games and right on the pebble beach. It was awesome that you can hire kayaks and bikes onsite. A true 2 bedroom room which is great for a family A Fantastic location and view. Reviewed 20 Apr 2018 What a wonderful place to stay! We booked a ground floor 1 bedroom unit and couldn't have asked for a better view or location. Besides being right on the waterfront, it is only one street away from the main shopping and eating area. The unit was spacious, had lots of comfortable seating, nice bedroom, bathroom and kitchen facilities. I couldn't stop taking photos from our unit! Nice grassed area for children to play in. Manager and staff were very friendly. Highly recommend. Pat339 Fabulous setting by the sea Reviewed 22 Jan 2018 Great room with sea views and lovely balcony, very clean with everything we needed for a restful holiday! Hosts very helpful and friendly. Easy walk to restaurants, cafes etc. great facilities for families. Graeme Private and as close to the water as possible Reviewed 30 Apr 2018 We are thrilled with the unit we have at the Akaroa Waterfront Motels - Unit 90. It's a 1 bedroom upstairs unit with beautiful water views from the living area. The unit is clean, spacious and well appointed. There is a shower with good water pressure (no bath) and plenty of seating options in the living area and a couple of comfortable stools/chairs on the balcony. We would definitely recommend staying here if you want to be away from the hustle and bustle of Akaroa and yet within very easy walking distance of some incredible restaurants. It's down the Children's Bay end of Akaroa and we found it to be extremely relaxing. Jules Friendly and overall excellent place to stay for great views Reviewed 14 Apr 2017 The room looked out to the waterfront. Was an amazing view. Wall heater in the bedroom helped because it was very cold. Reception staff were excellent. Jessie Recommended place to stay in Akaroa Reviewed 15 Apr 2017 Really handy location. Close to everything and quiet. Richard A wonderful position Reviewed 12 Mar 2017 The Waterfront Motel is definitely one of the best motels we have stayed in, in our trip around the South Island NZ. It had everything, good position, excellent staff, modern rooms and an excellent view across the bay. Michael What a view at Akaroa Waterfront Motels Reviewed 10 Mar 2017 We spent a most enjoyable weekend here to celebrate a 70th birthday. We couldn't have chosen a more fitting place to stay. We had an upstairs studio unit that was very well appointed and overlooking the bay - what a way to wake up in a morning - a very relaxing weekend. Special thanks to the staff for their co-operation with a request that was made of them. We enjoyed our weekend so much that we have already booked another!! Ideally situated on the edge of the township but within easy walking distance of the pier, attractions, restaurants and cafes with open attractive grounds and ample parking. Joan Fabulous stay Reviewed 01 Mar 2017 This waterfront motel had a great kitchen, good beds and a fabulous view. The staff was friendly and helpful. We were there 4 nights and were sad to leave. They have bike rentals and sit on kayaks to rent for a very reasonable price. Anna A Jolie surprise Reviewed 14 Jan 2017 We stayed right on the waterfront. The apartment was very clean and well appointed. So much thought into fun for the family: snooker table, large connect four, games all laid out and on Sundays, a crepe wagon... sad not to visit on a Sunday. Blissful night, we would love to return.
