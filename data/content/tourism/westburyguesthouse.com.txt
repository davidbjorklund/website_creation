Within an easy walk of our guest house is the town centre and harbour, with cafes and restaurants and of course the pedestrian shopping street which still retains many independent retailers. Many people, of course come to Brixham for fishing and there are plenty of organised fishing trips available, from the small mackerel boats to trips specialising in catching bigger fish. For the golfing enthusiast, Churston Golf Club is but a short 2 mile drive away. Brixham also has a number of ferry operators, offering trips to Paignton, Torquay & Dartmouth. Dartmouth itself is well worth a visit especially during Regatta week, where usually the Red Arrow Dispaly team can be seen in what must be one of their most spectacular displays. Avid Agatha Christie fans are in for a treat as her home at Greenway is now open to visitors., Greenway is a 4 mile drive by car from the guest house but can also be visited by boat from Dartmouth. Steam railway enthusiasts can ride the South Devon Railway, which runs between Totnes & Buckfastleigh. Closer is the Dartmouth Steam Railway operating between Paignton and Dartmouth. end .moreInfo Click to hide additional text <div class="picture"> <img src="images/IMG_6391.jpg" alt="Painting of Westbury Guest House" title="Painted by a guest of the Westbury"> <p class="centre">A painting of Westbury Guest House, painted by a guest.</p> </div> <div class="picture"> <img src="images/IMG_8599.jpg" alt="Westbury Guest House - April 2015" title="Westbury Guest House - April 2015"> <p class="centre">Westbury Guest House - April 2015</p> </div> Westbury Guest House - March 2018 Tweet Westbury Guest House 40 reviews <img class="noImage" src="images/IMG_8602.jpg" alt="View of Westbury Guest House - April 2015" /> <iframe src="http://www.youtube.com/embed/SYzTDDW2QHs"></iframe> On site parking 5/6 minutes level walk to the harbour Free WiFi available Flat screen TV Close to fishing facilities Large terrace for guests to use Freshly cooked delicious breakfast Special dietary requirement catered for Iron available on request Holiday in SOUTH DEVON at 'The Westbury Guest House' BRIXHAM - the gem of the English Riviera Whilst we welcome partially disabled guests we have no ground floor guest accommodation.
