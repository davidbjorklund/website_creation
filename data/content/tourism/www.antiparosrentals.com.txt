All apartments are equipped with a kitchen, outside furniture, large balconies and air conditioning. All are within walking distance to beaches and all facilities. Antiparos is a small cycladic island surrounded by Paros, Naxos, Mykonos, Santorini, Delos, Sifnos and Ios. A beautiful boat trip through the Aegean sea or a short domestic flight from Greece's capitol, Athens, takes you to the larger neighbor island of Paros, and from there it is only a five minute ferry trip over to small Antiparos . Antiparos is an idyllic, small island where you will find ‘everything‘ within walking distance. It is a perfect island for families, friends or couples. On the one and only main street, where there are no cars allowed, you will find everything you need, from small cafes, restaurants with local greek or international cuisine, trendy and traditional shops blended together, museums, supermarkets, etc. Antiparos is also famous for its cave, located approximately 8km from the village, which is a must-see when visiting the island. In addition, Antiparos offers beautiful beaches and clean waters, inside and outside town. So whether you are looking for shopping, dining, dancing, lazy days on the beach, diving, kiting or other sports activities, Antiparos offers it all. Enjoy your stay, and welcome to Antiparos !
