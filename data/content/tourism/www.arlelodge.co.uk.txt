We were welcomed warmly and shown around by Hannah (who, by the way, is a brilliant photographer) - if we had needed any further help there was always someone available in the office at the main house. Our party consisted of me, my son and grandson (aged 5) and we shared an en-suite family room which was more than big enough for our needs. The room was clean and the beds were very comfortable. We could boost the heating if necessary which was useful with a wee one in the group. The large lounge/ open plan kitchen was very well equipped with all you would need to prepare your own meals if you wished (even a slow cooker!) Plenty of fridge/freezer space for visitors and boxes to store your dry foods. The breakfast selection was good - several choices of cereals, porridge oats, bread, croissants, butter, jams/marmalades, juices and fruit salad. More than enough really but you could always bring in your own bacon, etc if you are a 'full English' person! Comfy sofas, games and a large TV (plus free wi-fi) were great for the adults while the bairn enjoyed playing in the garden and watching the sheep. If you visit in the warmer months there are several picnic benches and a couple of barbeque areas outside. Arle Lodge was a good base for visiting the island - close to Tobermory (Balamory), the main reason for our trip this time - and was easy to find on the road from the ferries to Tobermory. We loved the concept of self catering/ B&B and enjoyed the freedom to come and go at will which is not possible with a conventional bed and breakfast. We would certainly go back to Mull as we only scratched the surface in our couple of days there and will definitely stay at Arle Lodge on our next visit."
