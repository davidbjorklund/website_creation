Contact Barbara at 303 478-6832 or email: DenverMaui@gmail.com Begin Right Column Why Wailea? Coming from Denver, we preferred the drier, sunnier climate of South Maui to that of the wetter West Maui area. Looking around Wailea, our priority was to be able to enjoy an easy and flat walk to the beach rather than drive and it was clear that the ocean front Ekahi Village and especially 5B's location gave us that and so much more. The low density , the beautifully landscaped grounds , the 4 pools , the beach pavilion and especially, Keawakapu Beach , all combine to make Wailea Ekahi Village in Maui a very special paradise.
