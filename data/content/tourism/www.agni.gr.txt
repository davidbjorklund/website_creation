Before choosing a holiday, many, quite rightly, question the safety of the location. You will pleased to know that Greece is one of the safest holiday destinations in Europe. The local Corfiots are a close community and will immediately investigate a suspicious person! Corfu is a safe holiday destination, the locals honest. Crime and theft is very rare. Many locals do not lock their car or homes. You need not worry about walking on your own at night. Many single people visit and feel safe at night. If there is any danger at all, it would be from other tourists! Corfu a Safe Holiday Destination Vaccinations for Corfu No vaccinations are required for visiting Corfu or Greece. There is no risk of malaria in Greece or any other tropical diseases. What are those black nets for under the trees? To collect olives. The locals that do not earning a living from tourism, often turn to Olives. There are an estimated 3 million Olive trees on Corfu - no wonder the island is so green! Find out how they are grown, collected (using the nets) and then pressed - the olives not the tourists! Corfu Olives What island is that opposite Corfu? It is Albania! Few of Corfu's first-time visitors, realise how close the previous communist state of Albania is - in places less than 2 miles across the water. It is quite safe though! Many years ago, there were reports of 'Albanian Pirates' swimming across to steal boats from local Corfiots. This was an isolated event and is now unheard of. If you are really intrigued, it is possible to go on a local ferry (from Corfu town) and visit Albania for the day. Having visited several times, it is fascinating, but I am not sure whether I would enjoy the day more just sitting around the pool with a good book! Day Trips to Albania Corfu: Popular Destinations Kalami Corfu Kalami bay is set nestling below the North East Corfu hills and famous for the Durrel's 'White House' and beautiful beach. Kalami is a popular destination for couples and also suits a family holiday; families with both young children and teenagers will find this resort an ideal holiday away from the hustle and bustle of the busier towns on the island and yet typically Greek. Kalami Corfu Kassiopi Corfu Kassiopi is a lively resort at the North East corner of Corfu. A charming little fishing village, with a traditional port. Tourism has of course had its influence, but you can still find local fishermen bringing home the morning catch down at the harbour. Kassiopi Corfu Roda Corfu Roda is a Corfufishing village and a small family beach resort, it is mostly used by the British package tour operators. There is a super sandy beach. The original town has developed, but you will still find locals continuing their everyday life. Roda Corfu Sidari Corfu Sidari is ideal for families looking for a package holiday. The resort is much larger than Roda. There are several beaches and many lively activities. Roda Corfu Saint Stephanos Corfu Agios Stephanos is a small fishing village, located on the North East coast of Corfu. (Rather confusing, as there is another Agios Stephanos located on the North West coast) This little fishing village has now become a very popular 'up market' resort with many stylish villas for rent. Saint Stephanos Corfu Arilas Corfu The resort of Arillas is quiet and mainly for families and couples. Thankfully. there is not much around Arillas except for the beach and swimming! Arilas Corfu Paleokastritsa Corfu Paleokastritsa is set around three main bays. It is famous for being Corfu's most treasured beauty spot, and becomes busy with day trippers throughout the season. Luxury yachts sail in to admire the back drop of the beautiful green hills around Paleokastritsa. Paleokastritsa Corfu Glyfada Corfu If you are looking for a stunning sandy beach - probably the finest the island has to offer - then Glyfada should be on your list. There are several bars and tavernas around Glyfada beach as well as the usual hotels and a few apartments. Glyfada Corfu Nissaki Corfu Nissaki means Little Island and hundreds of years ago that is what it was. On top of the island, now stands a Taverna. In years past, the local people worked on this island, shaping stones and local rocks bought to them by boat. The stones were used for building. After many years, the chippings falling into sea formed a ramp and eventually joined the land. Now there is a narrow road that now runs between the old island where the Taverna stands and the mainland. Nissaki has a small beach and is extremely pretty. The beach is a small horseshoe shape with fine pebbles, offering excellent swimming, although it can become a little crowded when daytrip boats arrive for lunch. Nissaki Corfu Kaminaki Corfu Kaminaki is one of Corfu's best kept secrets. A tiny breach-fronted village, tucked away amongst the olive groves. The bay is a beautiful well kept secret with sparkling white pebbles and a turquoise water gently lapping against the beach. It is almost a dream and probably the one that many of us have when we picture a small Greek holiday destination. One Taverna sits right on the beach, while another sits up high on the rocks overlooking the bay. The atmosphere is friendly - not dissimilar to other smaller coastal resorts in the area. The local boat hire owners chat to you as you stroll along the waters edge. The bay has remained untouched by tourism.

Recent Newspaper and television news stories have recently focused on Corfu concerning the "Agni-Gate" scandle between Mr George Osborne and Mr Mandelson. Why do Mr Osborne and Mr Mandelson holiday on Corfu and more specifically within the Agni region? Those that regularly visit Corfu will already know! Unspoilt Locations Due to strict planning regulations, Corfu does not have any building higher than two levels.(Some hotels were permitted to be built during the 1970s, but thankfully only a few.) This has prevented traditional hotels (and the mass tourism that often accompanies them) from damaging the Corfu coastline. Choice of Villas The Corfu Coastline now has a sprinkling of Villas, with some of the small fishing harbours and ports being a cluster of typical Greek houses or apartments. The hills high above have small traditional villages and private and secluded Villas (usually with a private pool.) For more details: Corfu Rental Villas Corfu Town - Kerkyra "Corfu town is Venice and Naples, a touch of France and more than a dash of England, apart of course from being Greek" - Countess Flamburiari. Kerkyra or Corfu Town, is the capital of Corfu. The town is a historic maze of narrow streets dominated by the 16th century fortress. Around every corner can you can find a chapel, old mansion or secret garden square. The cafÃ© at the Liston: built by the French in the same style as those in Rue de Rivoli, Paris; is probably the place to 'people watch' while enjoying a Ginger beer. (The British also left Cricket, which was played on the pitch opposite the Liston. Sadly today, due to nearby parked cars, they no long play in this famous location.) The narrow streets radiating off from the Liston, house small shops of every commercial nature. Dominated by the 'gold shops'. Corfiot craftsmen excel at designing and making Greek jewelry in gold - this coupled with competitive prices may tempt you. Among the bustle, look out for those shops and stalls selling local items like wild honey, fig cakes and handmade lace. The most famous church on Corfu, and the most visited, is Saint Spiridon's Church, home to the island's patron 'mummified' saint, is just behind the Liston. The church is impressive and worth visiting, but please ensure you are suitably dressed before visited this holy site. All Rights Reserved.
