Testimonials âBlack Sand Apartments are run by a fantastic family of Stefanos and Mantha, lovely couple who I know for ages. We stayed in that fantastic hotel even few years before they built the swimming pool, one of the most beautiful in Kamari, decorated by a natural rock. The view is spectacular and the huge rooms offer plenty of space, extremely nice. Stefanos and his father do often make barbecue for their guests, just to make them feel even better. The bar by the pool offers snacks and drinks. The beach is just two minutes away, cannot imagine a better location. Certainly one of the best places to stay on the island. Amazing hotel! - âI have just returned back from Santorini with my wife and 11 month old daughter after attending my friends wedding. This is by far one of the nicest places I have ever visited and the holiday was made even better by the warm and friendly people at Black Sand. Mantha and her family couldn’t do enough for us and as this was our first trip abroad with our daughter they made us feel at ease and were a great help. The apartment itself was lovely. It was clean, spacious and well maintained. There is a lovely pool area and the food……WOW!â - âJust got back from our holiday/wedding and stayed at Black Sands apts, Mantha and Stephanos couldn’t be more helpful such great people, they catered for all our needs, we had a lot of friends and family staying here too with young children, they were made very welcome. Basically we took over the place. They put on a lovely BBQ and a singer the day after our wedding which was just perfect.â - âFamily run and made our young family feel more welcome than we could ever have expected. I seriously don’t know how there are 17 better rated hotels than ApartHotelÂ Black SandÂ Â in Kamari. I wouldn’t even bother trying to find out either. Black Sand is perfect, end of.â - Contact Details Phone: +30 22860 33871 Email: info@blacksand.gr Address: Kamari, 84700, Santorini, Greece Social Media Home Accommodations Photos Contact Book Online!
