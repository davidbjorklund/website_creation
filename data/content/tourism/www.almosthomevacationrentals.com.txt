Each bedroom has its own bathroom which is really nice too. The views from the deck are amazing. As well as the kitchen stocked with all the supplies you would need for all your own cooking. Colleen S. Ketchikan, AK END / ITEM ITEM We had everything there we needed for our fishing and bear hunt trip to Ketchikan. House was great and beautiful view of marina. Owner was very helpful. Eugene B. Ketchikan, AK END / ITEM ITEM We booked the bottom unit. There are beds everywhere and a big kitchen with a giant dining table. It had all the supplies that we could possibly need and was great for a big group. Both decks got a lot of use. It was quiet and had a nice view of Knudson Cove. The location could not have been better. It's near some great beaches, hiking trails, and lakes. Most importantly, it's away from the congestion of the cruise ship tourists but is an easy drive back into town. A rental car would be necessary to stay here, but that would be the only thing you'd need. Hannah H. Ketchikan, AK END / ITEM PHOTO GALLERY You'll be surrounded by nature in your personal oasis!
