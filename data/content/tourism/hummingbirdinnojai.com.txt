The pool and sundeck lounging area are completely enclosed for your safety and privacy. Enjoy a complementary coffee, hot coco and assorted teas each afternoon and evening. Our expansive front yard includes a large green lawn area perfect for a picnic and a contemplative wood bench. We strive to create the ideal atmosphere for shedding yesterday's concerns, feeling comfortable and just relaxing into the Ojai vibe. Chief Peak Mountain forms a massive postcard view from just about anywhere on the property, and our family of multi-colored, high-spirited little Hummingbirds don't seem to mind a bit how close you get.
