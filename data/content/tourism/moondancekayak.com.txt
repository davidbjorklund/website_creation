What Our Guests Say About Us… “Kristi, Huge thanks to you and Donal for a fantastic weekend.   I can often gauge the quality of an adventure by the number of times my kids say “Whoa, look at that!”, needless to say, I stopped counting after the first hour on our 3 day trip.  Such an exciting, relaxing, and friendly trip!  Donal is an amazing guide and great person.  Not only will I recommend your company, I will encourage my friends to consider doing a trip.  I hope to return someday and explore more of the islands!  And thanks for ordering the beautiful weather… ” – Paul Thormahlen, Montana  “Our crew is still talking about what a great day they had. The rest of the week they kept filling us in on all the species of plant and sea life we would find around the beach/island. Every once in a while you find someone who is truly deserving of the word awesome, Kristi fits that – they enjoyed the kayaking and the education on the area and all of what makes this area so special! ” – Ward McMillen, Missouri “Went here for a birthday party and it was the most magical kayaking experience! It literally felt like something you’d see in a movie or out of some sort of magical fairytale. The tour guides were incredibly helpful and friendly, too. 100% would come back again! ” – Soleil Sol, Washington State Facebook Pixel Code End Facebook Pixel Code #content #primary .inner-wrap #main Copyright © 2016 MoonDance Sea Kayak Adventures - Call Us at (360) 738-7664 FBICON how to remove image padding on bottom? <a href="http://www.facebook.com/moondancekayak" target="_blank"><img align="right" title="Like us on Facebook!" src="http://594.a33.myftpupload.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/facebook_icon-e1399399742695.png" alt="facebook_icon" width="16" height="16" /></a> /FBICON #page FareHarbor plugin activated
