Where the grass is so tall, and there’s a waterfall, And the meadowlark’s song is so fine. To this land I will go, where the wild flowers grow, And the mountains reach up to the sky, Oh the wind and the rain, and the hills and the plain, and the trail where the deer went by. Where the picket pin gibbers with all his might, and the chipmunk scampers along, The moose trots gracefully out of sight, And the thrush sings his beautiful song. The cold mountain streams with rainbow trout In the country that I’ll be roaming, The cave in the rocks, where the bear hide out In the mountains of old Wyoming. It’s mighty close to Heaven folks, On the map it’s just a dot. Man’s hand has not spoiled its beauty, It’s the country that Time forgot. –S. Gordon Hall .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Absaroka Mountain Lodge: East Yellowstone Cabin Rentals and Restaurant Absaroka Mountain Lodge is a small family owned and operated resort located 12 miles outside the East entrance of Yellowstone National Park and 39 miles west of Cody, Wyoming along the Northfork corridor that Teddy Roosevelt once deemed, “the most scenic in America.” Nestled in Gunbarrel Canyon among the towering pines and along the banks of Gunbarrel Creek, Absaroka Mountain Lodge has accommodated guests since the early 1900’s with authentic western hospitality.  Listed on the National Registry of Historic places, our Lodge was once owned by Buffalo Bill Cody’s grandson, Fred Garlow. All of our 15 rustic log cabins have their own cozy charm and have been modernized with heat, electricity, mini fridges, microwaves, and private bathrooms. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner Cabins and Rates Fishing .et_pb_column Trail Rides & Hiking Historic Lodge .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner To experience our Lodge and surroundings, please click on our 360 degree virtual tour below. .et_pb_text We love families! .et_pb_text Read Guest Comments .et_pb_column .et_pb_row_inner .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section .entry-content .et_pb_post #main-content Absaroka Mountain Lodge Craig and Carol 1231 North Fork Highway Cody, WY 82414 307-587-3963 Copyright Absaroka Mountain Lodge 2019 end .fwidget end .footer-widget Opening day of our 2019 season is May 20th and closing is on October 15th.
