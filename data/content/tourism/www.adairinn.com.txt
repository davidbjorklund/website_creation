Loved it! I have stayed at Adair twice in the last month. I loved it so much the first time that I decided to stay there again when I was back in the area. From the lovely decor to the delicious breakfast, it was uniformly wonderful. The rooms are quiet, the beds are comfortable. full review by lesliepd → Adair's Restaurant offers flavorful New England style cuisine in our intimate fireside dining room, al fresco on our outdoor garden patio, or in the cozy library pub.

The country estate was built in 1927 by Frank Hogan as a gift to his only daughter, Dorothy Adair Hogan, upon the occasion of her marriage to John W. Guider.
