The apartments are situated in a quiet position within walking distance of Sandown town centre, the beach and railway station. They have their own entrances and are completely self contained.  From Spring 2017 we have a brand new Hot Tub in the garden for all the guests to enjoy, this will be available all year round. /welcome /col-md-8 “Couldn’t fault it.” The apartment was perfect for us, spacious and clean and only a 10 min stroll to the sea front. The bed was really comfortable as well. We found everything we needed in a well equipped kitchen. We will definitely be re booking soon. Reviewed September 14th 2014 “Lovely apartment in a brilliant location” We have just returned from Sandown after staying for two weeks. I would just like to say that we had an actual brilliant time. The apartment was lovely and the location was even better. It was a five minute walk to the seafront/beach and town!! My two daughters aged 11 and 9 really enjoyed their stay. Reviewed August 26th 2014 “Beautiful, quiet and well-equipped” We stayed for 1 week and were delighted by the new and tidy furniture and well-equipped kitchen. The location is perfect (walking distance to all public transport, shops, beach) and we slept so well. The ideal base to explore the island for peace loving self-caterers.
