While there is a 1- and 2-bedroom condo at Ocean Bay Club, most guest units are 3- and 4-bedroom condominiums that comfortably accommodate eight or more people. Overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, the spacious living area opens to the large, oceanfront balcony where sea breezes and salty air tantalize your senses. Scan the horizon for passing ships and fishing vessels and carefully eye the open waters for swimming dolphins and large sea turtles. Watch boats of all sizes carry passengers across rolling waves as they fish, sightsee and enjoy the natural South Carolina beauty surrounding them. The view from your oceanfront balcony is incomparably pleasant. Ocean Bay Club is located on the oceanfront at 201 South Ocean Drive in North Myrtle Beach, along the well known stretch of road that is popular for shag dancing and beach music—the epitome of a family beach vacation. Walk to restaurants and local gift shops and take a spin on the dance floor at the nearby Spanish Galleon.
