The housekeeping staff was helpful, and the front desk staff gave me good advice on parking - and I saw them helping other guests with recommendations, too. Anonymous Clean and comfortable. Located close to Union Square where we wanted to be. Front desk friendly. Rooms updated but you can tell it is an older hotel. Breakfast provided but the frozen waffles that have thawed and are sitting out were not what I expected. There was cereal and fruit, coffee, etc. The elevator was a little scary and had not been inspected since 2013. Anonymous Nice, quiet place to stay. Worth the money, and within a 10 minute walk of many great restaurants and pubs. Anonymous I planned this trip at the last minute as a celebration weekend for my partner and I. I looked at a bunch of different options as you know staying in the heart of San Francisco can be very expensive. I was quite surprised at the cost for this hotel based upon the photos and descriptions of the hotel, room etc. The lobby was very nice and inviting as the photos show. We reserved a deluxe king room. When we walked into the room we were quite surprised at how small the room was. Right under the tv is a small stand/bookcase where the coffee pot and mini fridge are. You can hardly walk past it because the bed and it are practically on top of each other. Basically the room is just a bit bigger than the king bed. The bathroom was quite small as well but very clean as was the room. The other downside in my opinion is there was no a/c option for the room and I found it to be quite stuffy. Anonymous I travel to San Francisco every other week and have stayed in many hotels. The Adante is one of the best hotels for the money, especially for the single traveler like me. The room is not large, but the bed is comfortable and the TV is new and large. The breakfast in the morning is free and pretty good, although crowded most mornings. The staff is helpful and professional. Anonymous We were looking for value and it's always risky when doing that. Adante delivered that and more...especially pleased with the helpful friendly staff. Excellent location!! Anonymous Great and helpful staff, clean rooms and great charm. It was a perfect balance between old and new. Breakfast definitely needs an upgrade though. Anonymous Stay in wheel chair accessible room on 5th floor. Nice size room even bigger bathroom, almost unnecessarily big. Next door is a great bar with high quality custom drinks and a great Thai restaurant. Break is standard. Anonymous Great location, very central, cosy and clean room Breakfast doesn't match with the level of the hotel Anonymous We loved the Adante, for our first time in San Francisco it was the perfect location for a good price.
