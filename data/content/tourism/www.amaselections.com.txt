Nothing has been too much trouble for A.M.A Selections. It also helps that they are lovely people who genuinely want to see your expectations delivered in full. If it were possible, I would book with them to go to the moon. Phil Yates Stayed in Villa Didier Great service and lovely team. Super professional and responsive. The villas are all wonderful and hi-sped. We will continue to be repeat customers. CK Stayed in Villa Du Village The service from the company was amazing, and the team was so helpful in making our stay as comfortable as possible. Attention to detail and flexible and accommodated our requests with pleasure. I strongly recommend this company. Omar Qattan Stayed in Villa Di Vorno We could not have had a better experience. Mariek and her staff assisted us quickly and thoroughly every step of the way from reservation to check out. Anne Pirzadeh Stayed in Bastide De Castellaras A.M.A Selections are excellent at what they do and the teams attention to every little detail is first class. A.M.A got everything right from start to finish. They helped with every aspect of my holiday, booking a fabulous wine tour, organising a perfume making class in Grasse, recommending restaurants, day trips, etc. Many thanks again for making my holiday and birthday celebrations so special. Michelle Doyle Stayed in Villa Du Village A.M.A Selections had the best customer service I’ve ever had while renting properties in Europe. The property was beautiful and they were on call at all hours to help with itineraries and reservations and any house questions. They arranged a daily chef, housekeeping and a taxi boat to take us to and from St. Tropez every day. Thanks for such a perfect trip! Ellen H. Stayed in Villa Clare From start to finish A.M.A was exemplary! I always say “you don’t get a second chance at a first impression” and from the start everything was no trouble and all inquiries responded to immediately. I recommend them on a daily basis actually! Just a pleasure to deal with.
