It is the longest curtain of falling water known to man as well as being one of the wonders of the world. But you will miss out on many fascinating facts and features if you go on this tour without a guide. The above is a very small picture of the whole. Just to whet your appetite. Block3 Lion Walk Did you ever imagine yourself and the king of the jungle walking side by side??? No he hasnât gone soft, he has just gone on a âno humanâ diet for a while. With your heart in your mouth and a big smile on your face, this is an experience you will live to remember. And for a bonus, when you walk with lions, the proceeds will help extend the existence of this vulnerable species, (mother nature canât do it on her own). Block3 Helicopter Flight Termed, âflight of angelsâ, this is truly an experience of a lifetime.

The above is a very small picture of the whole. Just to whet your appetite. Block3 Bungee Jumping Every tried flying without wings? Impossible you say! Well not necessarily. You donât have to be an adrenaline junkie to want to experience how it feels to fly, how it feels to be like a bird.

Professional crew and safety chat beforehand, as well as strong durable harnesses, we guarantee that safety is a priority. The above is a very small picture of the whole. Just to whet your appetite. Block3 Flying Fox This activity is like taking a run into the thin air over the Victoria Falls gorges, 200 metres wide and 120 metres deep.
