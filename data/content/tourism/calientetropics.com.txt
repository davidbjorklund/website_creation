Clean room. 4.1999998092651 on Booking.com , Jul 07, 2019 Sarah Very Good The lock on our door was broken, but because we checked in late there were no other options. The light outside of our door didn't work which made it extra sketch. The shower knob where you turn on the water was also broken. It was very difficult to turn on. Overall the place was awesome. The way it was themed, the comfort of the beds and the price would definitely bring us back! The pool and food looked great but we didn't have a chance to enjoy them|! 4.8000001907349 on Booking.com , Jul 07, 2019 Chris Exceptional A bit warm (desert heat) Tiki bar, and awesome pool 3.7999999523163 on Booking.com , Jul 07, 2019 Maria Good mattress amenities, pool, garden 4 on Google , Jul 06, 2019 Bodhi One of the best Tiki bars in Palm Springs. T whole hotel has a great Tiki decor! The bar is small and the drinks are pretty good and fairly priced ($10-14 in 2019). They have live music from time to time as well. Definitely a must visit when in town. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 06, 2019 Anonymous Comfortable and convenient. We had a room looking into the parking area, so not much of a view, but that did not matter for an overnight stay. A convenient stopover for us on a touring holiday. Comfortable, well equipped and air conditioned. Wish we'd had time to use the pool, but we arrived in the evening after a long day of driving and needed to leave in the morning for the next stretch of our route. Good restaurant on site. The whole complex was attractive. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 05, 2019 Valerie Exceptional 5 on Booking.com , Jul 05, 2019 Laura Exceptional 4 on Booking.com , Jul 05, 2019 José Very Good Nada em particular. Hotel muito agradável e bem localizado. Atendimento no check in e no check out muito rápido e descomplicado. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 05, 2019 Tnt 4th of July 2019 For as many rooms onsite the pool was not large enough. Soda machine was out of items our forst night. Reef hours on 4th didnt open early enough Not enough umbrellas at the pool. It was noisey when rooms next door and above turned on water/shower. We were near places we wanted to go such as eateries, sundries and entertainment. Staff was helpful and very accomodating. There was an error in our reservation and it was corrected immediately and we received a larger room. Great customer Service 3.7999999523163 on Booking.com , Jul 04, 2019 Christina Good 4.1999998092651 on Booking.com , Jul 04, 2019 Georg Very Good Der Pool müsste öfter gereinigt werden, viele Gäste hatten ihre Hunde u Katzen mit am Pool, das hat uns eher gestört Sehr schöne Anlage in tropischem Stil, großer Pool, sehr gute Lage, Poolbar, ausreichend Liegen, alles in allem ein super Motel 5 on Google , Jul 04, 2019 xxxxx .hTt9T{color:#999;font-size:13px;line-height:18px}.XihnJe{font-weight:bold;padding-right:8px}.d29ft{display:inline-block;padding:0 4px} 3.7999999523163 on Booking.com , Jul 04, 2019 Songfeng Good 4.1999998092651 on Booking.com , Jul 04, 2019 Cynthia Very Good 4.4000000953674 on Booking.com , Jul 03, 2019 Pas60500 Excellent RIEN Piscine et Jacuzzi très agréable, de nombreux transats mis a dispo. Grande chambre bien équipée et calme. Personnel agréable et serviable. Un bon hotel pour séjourner a Palm Springs 4.8000001907349 on Booking.com , Jul 03, 2019 Tamara Wonderful, 100% recommend. The bed wasn't super comfortable, it felt worn out. The AC seemed to be struggling to keep up with the heat at times, but it didn't bother us. Don't have negative things to say really, we will definitely come back. The pool was great and the restaurant has great happy hour prices in the afternoon (weekdays only). Plenty of parking. Room was nice and clean. It's not too far from downtown by car. We very much enjoyed our stay! It's walking distance from Koffi coffee, great for a quick breakfast. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 03, 2019 Anonymous Exceptional Can't take your own food and drinks to the pool area. The pool was a little dirty. Need to have a skimmer on hand. The rooms are spacious. The pool area is a good scene. The staff is helpful and friendly. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 03, 2019 Corey Awesome place The pool was really great and so was the indoor outdoor restaurant. 5 on Booking.com , Jul 02, 2019 Hannah Exceptional 4 on Google , Jul 02, 2019 Julie Nice place to stay, 3rd time staying here.
