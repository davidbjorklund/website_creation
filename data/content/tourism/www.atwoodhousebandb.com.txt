Atwood House Bed and Breakfast, Lodging in Chillicothe, Ohio ImageReady Slices (index.psd) Welcome The Atwood House is a Greek Revival house built in 1843 by Jacob Atwood, a financier from Baltimore, MD. The front bricks of the home were brought by canal from the Atwood’s foundry in Baltimore, and the rest were made in a foundry constructed in the basement. Only three families have owned the house since it was built, and only two families for the first 150 years. It was bought and redecorated in the fall of 2002 and opened as a bed and breakfast in June of 2003. Only about an hour from Dayton, Columbus and Cincinnati, the house is located in historic downtown Chillicothe, making it perfect for weddings, receptions and parties. Our Story “He was very nice and pleasant,” said Bill Hirsch, of his previous position as four-year butler to the late President Nixon. “I always like doing things for other people. And I’m very good at it.” Hirsch is continuing his passion for hosting as owner of the Atwood House - filled with an aura of history and Greek revival. After 15 years in New York City, Hirsch returned to his hometown of Chillicothe to fulfill his dream of opening a wining-and-dining establishment. Hirsch did all the decorating himself, but stressed that not much has changed over the years. He said a house that old that hasn’t been altered in any major way is a rare find. “This is the way people lived 150 years ago,” he said. “It’s hardly been touched in that time. When you step through that door, you’re pretty much in the 1800’s.” End ImageReady Slices
