More About Agri Tours Ireland Why Pick Ireland for your Farm Tour? Ireland's fertile soil, ample rainfall and temperate climate is perfect for growing, with Ireland's grass said to be the best in the world. Ryegrass is used as inexpensive feed primarily for beef and dairy farming. Around 80% of the land is for pasture, silage and hay, the remainder used for growing crops and rough grazing. A modern, sustainable and profitable industry has emerged to take advantage of this, with all areas of agriculture and food development in Ireland following suit. Agricultural tours of Ireland allow you to see what makes the best beef , the best dairy products , the highest wheat yields , the fastest racehorses , and the fastest growing conifers .

With our years of experience we have honed our tours to ensure you see the best of real Ireland while you are here. Amongst the Farms and Forests of Ireland, there are Ancient Stones and Crosses, Magnificent Castles and Monasteries; the sheep graze along mountain trails and the farmer enjoys live music and a pint in the local pub. Agri Tours are happy to provide these authentic Irish experiences while you visiting Irish Farms. <a class="button" href="/tours/other-visits.php">Discover the Non-Farming Attractions of Ireland</a> Your Tour Your Way Just let us know the perfect balance for your tour and we will create a unique itinerary to match.
