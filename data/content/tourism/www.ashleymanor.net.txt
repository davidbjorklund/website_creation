Our Barnstable, MA bed and breakfast offers two acres of park-like grounds with a spacious backyard patio, gazebo, and tennis court for our guests’ enjoyment. Our six romantic guest rooms include four luxury suites and two traditional rooms. Each suite features a wood-burning fireplace, full private bath, and a separate two-person Jacuzzi tub, Wi-Fi, and parking. On sunny summer days you can enjoy a full gourmet breakfast on the patio overlooking the spacious gardens and tennis court.  In cooler months, enjoy your breakfast in front of a roaring fire in the formal dining room. Originally built in 1699, Ashley Manor has seen many additions over the centuries. Evidence of its age and history can be seen in the wide-board flooring (wood usually reserved for the king during colonial times), huge open-hearth fireplaces(one with a beehive oven), hand-glazed wainscoting throughout the inn, and a secret passage connecting the upstairs and downstairs —thought to be a hiding place for Tories during the Revolutionary War. Each room has its own special charm…some feature New England shuttered windows, or colorful old Nantucket speckled floors, or canopy and pencil-post beds. All include those lovely small touches that reveal the innkeepers’ caring attention to detail and your comfort: Wi-Fi, imported bedside chocolates, the finest soaps, shampoos and lotions, and in-room coffee and tea service for the early riser. Every room has a comfortable sitting area for two, where you can enjoy that cup of tea, or perhaps a good book. After a day of touring , Ashley Manor will welcome you back…for a set of tennis, to enjoy one of the many books in the library, and for complimentary cordials in the evening. Relax on the terrace or enjoy a luxurious whirlpool bath before dinner at one of the nearby fine restaurants. Surely, the early Cape Codder’s lived this well… .entry-content .entry-meta #post-2 #comments #content #primary #secondary .widget-area A Note from the Innkeepers Check out our  Summer Stay and Fish Package !
