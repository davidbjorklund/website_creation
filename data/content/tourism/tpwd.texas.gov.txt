Invaders like giant salvinia and zebra mussels can hitch a ride on your boats and trailers. What can you do to help? Always clean, drain, and dry your boat, trailer, and gear before traveling from lake to lake. Do you store your boat in the water? If there are zebra mussels in that lake, they have very likely attached to your boat. Before moving it to another lake, decontaminate it. Call us at (512) 389-4848 for guidance. /wrapper Watch TPW Television Airing on PBS this Week Wildlife Watchdogs, Lake Forkers & Good Guzzlers Meet a team of biologists tasked with investigating oil spills or other environmental disasters affecting Texas wildlife.

Imported shrimp can carry a virus that can kill our native shrimp, crayfish and crabs. Shrimp from any other country or any non-Gulf state is considered imported, and it cannot be used as bait. Familiarize yourself with common imported shrimp and the 4 acceptable types of bait shrimp . If you buy frozen bait shrimp, check the origin on the package. /wrapper Magazine Return of the River Otter River otters are considered a “sentinel species” because they're very sensitive to pollution. By the 1970s they were reduced to a small population in Texas. But river otters are making a comeback and have been seen as far west as Austin. Watch this video of an otter having lunch at Fairfield Lake State Park. The otter's return indicates the waterways they enjoy are relatively healthy, good news for us all. Look for them on Texas Paddling Trails and the Great Texas Wildlife Trails in East Texas. /wrapper /content-wrapper /left-col-wrapper Column 1 Left ends Column 3 Right starts Facebook Twitter Pinterest /social-wrapper TPWD News & Media More » TPWD Drawn Hunt Permit Applications Now Being Accepted Game-changing, bipartisan wildlife legislation introduced in Congress Galveston Island State Park Remains Open Before Beachside Project Begins Ten Grants Awarded by Winners of Great Texas Birding Classic Game Warden Field Notes /wrapper Hot Topics MLDP Registration Information Monarch Butterfly Chronic Wasting Disease Cost Efficiency Suggestion Poll /wrapper /news-wrapper Spotlight on TPWD Homepage_spotlight_1 Homepage_spotlight_2 Homepage_spotlight_3 Homepage_spotlight_4 /col-one TPW Magazine Advertisers Ad Info Homepage_TPWMag250x250_1 Homepage_TPWMag250X100_2 /col-two /spotlights-wrapper /right-col-wrapper Column 3 Right ends /container /row landingpage-wrapper lampwrapper end from header.php    Email Updates /sign-up-tab /sign-up Sign Up for Email Updates.
