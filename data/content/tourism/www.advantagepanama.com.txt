Lodges The Darien Sightings & News Special Discounts FAQ Fin de BARRA MENU2 About Panama & Our Company For many years, this tiny country roughly the size of South Carolina, was only known for the engineering Wonder of the World that connects the Pacific and Atlantic oceans: the Panama Canal. However, during the last few years, more and more people are starting to discover the vast natural and cultural wonders that Panama has to offer. Located between 7 and 9 degrees north of the Equator, Panama boasts immense tracks of tropical rainforest. Within its small surface it contains a great variety of tropical habitats; including Caribbean coral reefs, Pacific mangrove wetlands, dry tropical forests, wet rainforests, all the way to mountain cloudforests with their moss-laden, orchid-covered trees. Three-toed SlothFurthermore, these tropical ecosystems harbor an incredible diversity of colorful flowers and plants, and a wide array of wild animals like sloths, toucans, anteaters, monkeys, etc. For example, in Panama there are about 960 different species of birds; that is far more than the total number of species found in the U.S. and Canada, combined ! Having more than 30% of its national territory protected, Panama presents excellent opportunities to see wildlife and learn about tropical environments. Most interesting is the fact that many of these protected areas are readily accessible, only minutes from the modern capital: Panama City. For millennia people in the Americas have come through Panama in their journeys to colonize South America. Still today we can find the descendants of these indigenous groups comprising more than 10% of Panama's population. These tribes maintain their traditions much like they did centuries ago. It is an almost surreal experience to leave the skyscrapers of Panama City and only 40 miles away cruise up the majestic Chagres River in a dugout canoe through dense jungle, to come in contact with villagers that still live in the rainforest. In addition, the settling of the continent by the Spaniards, the construction of the first Trans-Continental railroad, the French attempt to build a Canal, and later the American enterprise to build the waterway, has brought different peoples, the world over, to live in Panama. They have all contributed incredibly to the diverse culture of this tropical paradise. Panama City SkylineEven today, the flourishing trade between the East and West, taking place at the Colon Free Trade Zone and the financial district, attracts businesspeople from Europe, Asia, and Latin America to meet in Panama. This condition ensures a cultural diversity unparalleled in the rest of the region, and provides a very interesting cosmopolitan feel to the country. Moreover, Panama is one of the safest countries in Latin America with a very low crime rate. In all the main towns you can find modern infrastructure, safe drinking water, in short: all the comforts of today's First World life. And, Yes! There is the Panama Canal that now under Panamanian administration, continues to operate very efficiently; ensuring world commerce for centuries to come.
