Our reaction to the room was "Oh Lovely!" simultaneously as Caroline opened the door. Clean, well kept, spacious.  The breakfast was the best we had in our weeks stay in Scotland. Caroline is lovely and helpful. We really couldn't ask for more! Highly recommend! Perth is a beautiful city and The Albert Villa a great place to stay! Room Tip: If our room was anything to go by any room will be good! <div class="ratingBx"> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> "Michelle G" "13 May 2017" View All The warm welcome. Caroline and Alistair are always welcoming, and make sure our stay is comfortable. Our room is always ready for us when we arrive after a very long drive. The breakfast fills you up nicely for the day without leaving you bloated, and the location is a short walk from the centre of town. Parking may be a little awkward as there are only a couple of spaces in front, the remaining spaces being down a narrow driveway and large cars may struggle to get in. <div class="ratingBx"> <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> "Jens H" "27 April 2017" View All We stayed in this B&B for one night on our trip of 1 week through Scotland. This was the best place we have stayed. We had 2 rooms: an en-suite en a standard double room, The rooms were clean and large and everthing worked. Caroline and Alistair were very friendly and helpfull. The breakfast was top. We could also park at the back for free. <div class="ratingBx">5 <i class="fa fa-star" aria-hidden="true"></i></div> "Very nice place to stay" "20 September 2016" View All If you are staying in Perth for one night or longer, the Albert Villa is a great place to stay.

"16 August 2015" View All Caroline and Alistair were very accommodating.

Nothing, I say nothing compares to their hospitality. They would both go out of their way to make you as comfortable as possible. I would recommend the Albert Villa to anyone staying or passing through Perth. The rooms are very clean and cozy. I couldn't ask for more except that I wish they would have lunch and dinner in their menu so I wouldn't have to go elsewhere in the Cold!!! Love to Caroline and Alistair. Xoxo.
