At Acadia Bike, we have the equipment and the expertise to make your biking adventure one you'll remember for years to come. With 30 years of experience, we have the largest fleet of rental bicycles in New England, and our friendly staff will make sure you get the one that's perfect for you. Whether it's a mountain bike or a hybrid, we'll provide the equipment that will make your trip to Maine special. If you're a cycling enthusiast, you'll marvel at the endless routes available to you, and if you're a first-timer, you'll find out just how much fun you can have on a bike in Acadia National Park. We have everything you need, whether you plan to pedal on the island's wonderful carriage roads or plan to take the more heavily used Park Loop Road. Our friendly professionals at Acadia Bike will give you all the advice you need for a great day of bicycling. Because we continually sell bikes from our rental fleet, we have a wide variety of high-quality used bikes for sale at reasonable prices, many of which have been ridden only a few times. That keeps our rental fleet up to date at all times. We also carry a full line of new bikes and accessories for sale. We're open for bike rentals May 1 through October 31 of each year, and we're conveniently located at 48 Cottage Street in the heart of downtown Bar Harbor, gateway to Acadia National Park. Hours during June, July and August are 8 a.m. to 6 p.m., and from 9 a.m. until 5 p.m. in May, September and October. Our tours operate rain or shine. The free Bicycle Express shuttle , part of Acadia's Island Explorer system, departs from the Bar Harbor village green, only one block from our shop. It will give you and your bikes a free ride to and from the carriage roads of Acadia. The shuttle operates from June 23 until Sept. 30.              content-wrapper page-body-wrapper Purchase Gift Card Powered by Squarespace . page-footer-wrapper canvas-wrapper
