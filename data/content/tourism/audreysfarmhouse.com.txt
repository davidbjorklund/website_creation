SEE MORE THE FARMHOUSE Discover our Heritage Audrey's started in a cedar shingled farmhouse originally built in 1740, and it's where the brand gets its name. Audrey Leff first opened the doors of The Farmhouse to travelers and their pets in 1987. Some 28 years later Doug & Sally acquired the property and set about making their mark through design, food, and authentic hospitality. Today Audrey's operates The Farmhouse, The Greenhouses, and we're working on developing new concepts all the time. The Audrey's team has grown quickly from its two founders working tirelessly to keep up the 5 rooms in The Farmhouse. Audrey's is now a team of more than two dozen operating 20 rooms, a working greenhouse, events, collaborative dinners, and The Greenhouses Kitchenâa public restaurant at The Greenhouses. The creative team at Audrey's is currently working to develop a general store concept and working through early stages of another lodging & event facility.
