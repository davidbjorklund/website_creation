The Old Kasper House, built in 1906, was the model home of local building contractor, alderman, and cotton ginner John F. Kasper and his wife, Mary. It was an elegant home where old-world traditions were practiced and preserved from 1898 to 1960, including bee-keeping, wine-making, and woodworking. In 1986, Mary Ann and Hubert Novak began converting this lovely Victorian-style home into the Old Kasper House Bed & Breakfast. We've recently changed our name to the Old Kasper House Victorian Inn. After lots of loving hard work, we now have several different homes and cottages from which to choose. Each place has bedrooms, private baths, and living and dining areas with unique character and personality.
