Each suite contains a living and dining area, as well as a whirlpool tub, gas fireplace, entertainment center, and fully-equipped kitchen (with the exception of Suite #6 which has a kitchenette.) We would be happy to direct you to area attractions including antiques, quilts, hand-crafted furniture and Amish cooking.  Or, if you prefer, simply relax in our spacious guest quarters. In January, 2013, Holmes with a View welcomed John & Fannie Mae Miller, as the new Innkeepers and partners in the business. Not only were they friends and neighbors of the original owners, Paul & Miriam Grossi, they also assumed numerous responsibilities over the thirteen years Holmes with a View was in business, most recently that of Managers. John & Fannie Mae have 7 children and 16 grandchildren, many of whom live in the immediate neighborhood or within a few miles. We are confident that under their ownership Holmes with a View will continue in the same tradition, providing excellent service and unique lodging accommodations for guests visiting the area.
