" This house was perfect for our group of 5 adults and 9 kids, great layout and number of beds. The kitchen is roomy and the place has two dining tables. The property is nice and our kids were able to play outside some and have a great time." Becky May 2018 "Relax- beautiful porch rocking chairs out back looking out to mountains. Peaceful front porch to watch the sunset. Large grass yard with a fun tree swing. My grand kids and I loved it. It is nice to be away from the crowds, peaceful and serene plenty of room for kids to roam and plenty of space inside- we had 10 people." Dawn November 2017 Hostel Boise is the place to stay when discovering all that Boise and Southwest Idaho has to offer!
