Victorian mansion featuring relaxed accommodation in an elegant setting. In the summer, after a day of taking in the stunning scenery of the Bruce Peninsula, relax on the wraparound verandah with a glass of wine and enjoy the breeze off Georgian Bay. In the winter, explore the area’s many groomed Cross-country ski trails or curl up with a good book by the fireplace in your spacious en-suite room, or in our inviting library or music room. After a great night’s sleep in one of our “remarkably comfortable” queen size beds, wake up to the aroma of our much-praised Highland Manor Blend coffee. A sumptuous breakfast awaits you in our welcoming dining room. We serve a full home-cooked breakfast with fresh fruit, juice and a delicious hot entree. This changes daily and might include Orange French Toast with a warm berry compote and local maple syrup, or Baked Southwestern eggs, among many other specialties. We are happy to accommodate special dietary requirements. The Highland Manor has been selected to be on The Ontario Heritage Foundation’s “Doors Open Ontario” tour since 2005. We have also been featured in the Romance Issue of North American Inns Magazine, and the Greenwood Guide to Handpicked Accommodation in Canada. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Virtual Room Tours View a 360 degree virtual tour of our fabulous rooms.
