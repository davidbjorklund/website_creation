Ideally located in the heart of beautiful Salem Massachusetts. Our historic bed and breakfast was originally built for Amelia and Edward Payson in 1845 and features three well-appointed guest rooms with private bathrooms. Guests will also enjoy our formal dining room, comfortable sitting rooms, outside deck and manicured gardens. A homemade breakfast is served family style and includes a variety of fresh fruit, house-made granola, juices, coffee or tea and a main entree. We will accommodate any dietary restrictions that you may have. The Amelia Payson House was highlighted in Yankee Magazine as an Editor’s Choice Award and named in Fodor’s Travel as one of the best B&Bs in Salem, citing its excellent location, short walk to the Peabody Essex Museum, the Salem Maritime National Historic site, the House of the Seven Gables, the Witch Museum, unique shops, area attractions, a vibrant waterfront, distinctive dining establishments and transportation availability to Boston by Ferry (55 minutes) or a 35 minute train ride.
