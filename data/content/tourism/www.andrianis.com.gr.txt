BOOK NOW PROFESSIONALS Services Breakfast Safe Box WiFi Internet Room Service Car Rentals “Can definitely recommend, beautiful design, superb location, excellent and reliable service. Perfect location (Mykonos Town city center, vehicle rental company and main bus station are a 5 min walk), premises designed in beautiful white local style, delicious breakfast, good AC and free wifi, free transfer from airport and to port, reliable and friendly service (not overly warm but I surprisingly found that somewhat cool-distanced “Cyclades attitude” in many hotels, restaurants and shops in the Cyclades!)” Travelbug, Germany “Staying in the city center, going to a different beach each day is the best way to spend your time in Mykonos. It offers to pick-up from & drop to the ferry port. Best price/performance ever! The place has more than it offers. I would definitely go to Mykonos again and stay there!” Buhara, Turkey fusion-row #main Mykonos Town, 84600, Greece Phone: +30 2289023091 Fax: +30 2289078063 Email: info@andrianis.com.gr Tripadvisor Links Privacy Policy fusion-columns fusion-row fusion-footer-widget-area Copyright 2016 Andriani's Guest House | All Rights Reserved | Website By Webee.gr fusion-fusion-copyright-content fusion-row #footer fusion-footer wrapper W3TC-include-js-head Cookies To make this site work properly, we sometimes place small data files called cookies on your device.
