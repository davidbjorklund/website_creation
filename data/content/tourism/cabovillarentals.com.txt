Welcome to Baja California in Mexico! Cabo San Lucas is the ideal vacation destination. Only a short flight south of the Mexico/U.S.A. border, "Los Cabos" is the area comprised of Cabo San Lucas to the West, San Jose del Cabo to the East and the Resort Corridor which joins both of these two towns. Cabo San Lucas or "Cabo" for short, is known for it's excitement, shopping, activities, sportfishing, dining and nightlife, while San Jose del Cabo still retains some of the old world charm and a somewhat slower pace with art galleries, restaurants and shopping. There is only a 20 minute drive down the Resort Corridor connecting both towns. Whatever your choice, Los Cabos offers plenty of options for every taste. Mexico, our good neighbor to the south, has a proud history, a vibrant culture and offers a world of attractions, activities and scenery to enjoy. Mexico Villa Rentals' villas and resorts make it possible for you to experience Mexico in style and with all the comforts of home. We know Mexico. We've been vacationing there ourselves since 1968.
