The Towans | Holiday cottages on the North Coast of Cornwall Home Lodges Local Area Contact Home Lodges Local Area Contact End of header “Beautiful views ... Lovely quiet location but close to local amenities. Friendly, helpful advice from the onsite owners ... A truly wonderful experience!” Set on the dramatic north Cornwall coast, The Towans is dotted with secluded luxury lodges that make the most of a stunning setting that’s just moments from the beach. The traditional lodges wouldn’t look out of place in New England, and their luxurious interiors mean guests can enjoy the best of both worlds – the country life and stylish living. The lodges have bright, airy interiors with plenty of space and an impressive standard of furnishing that makes them warm and welcoming places to spend time together. To ensure that guests don’t miss a moment of the rural views, French windows flood the properties with natural light and see them filled with sunshine throughout the day. Set within extensive landscaped grounds amidst open countryside, The Towans is within an easy walk of beautiful Constantine Bay and the world class Trevose Golf Club, while just a short drive away you’ll find some of Cornwall’s best attractions, including Padstow, Watergate Bay and The Eden Project.
