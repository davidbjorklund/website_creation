The area is unparalleled for scenic mountains, waterfalls, lakes, streams, parklands and an amazing climate. At an elevation of over 3200 ft., our Class A luxury motorcoach resort has 4 true seasons for RV owners to experience. Spring is a gorgeous time to visit when the outdoors comes to life with beautiful blooms of azaleas, rhododendron, and mountain laurel – all native to our region. Summers are unique with the lush green foliage and an average June temperature of 71 degrees. Fall presents a great opportunity for motorcoach RVers to see nature at work with the leaves turning brilliant colors from mid-October through early November. Winter can be a good time to visit as well, with everything from beautiful blue skies and crystal-clear air to frosty snow-covered scenes with frozen forest sculptures. We are very excited and happy with the purchase of our lot in Mountain Falls. One of the best decisions we have made. It is a great neighborhood/community, along with the best mountain views in the world! We just love this place.
