Our 22 rooms are attractively decorated in traditional colonial style.  Each has a private bath, individually controlled heat and air conditioning, extended cable color TV.  Refrigerators are in all rooms. Five of the private baths include a shower instead of a bathtub to make it easier to enter and exit.  Parents, want some privacy from the kids? Ask us about our 2 bedroom unit. Many of our guests say that our rooms remind them of staying in a private cottage. In contrast to some newer hotels which have one window which does not open up for fresh air, our rooms have much more. Ten rooms have five windows – front and back, six rooms have three windows – front and back, four rooms have two windows on the front and two rooms have four windows on three sides. All of the windows open up for wonderful mountain fresh air, sunlight and mountain view. Previous Next 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 close column table wrapper.
