What people have to say "The Envy of all Other Guests" Botswana was incredible and a great recommendation. The combination of Gomoti, Jacana and Savuti provided a perfect balance... The camps were exactly what we were looking for and the game viewing was extraordinary. We did three full rounds of the 'Big 5' (three rhinos, five leopards and far too many of the other 3 to keep track of) and saw so many other species of mammals, birds and reptiles - (we did take over 2,500 photos and many videos.) The combination of the four camps and our experiences were the envy of all other guests we met - it was a perfect itinerary. All to say you could not have put together a better itinerary for Jeanette and me. Thank you very, very much. Barry & Jeanette - Botswana September 2017 "Safari Trip of a Lifetime" 'Mike, it way, way, exceeded all expectations, the family loved it and Mark said he had never seen Ivana so happy! I’ll report in more detail when you’re back, but rest assured, it’s been the trip of a lifetime. The sun is out today, I hope you find warmth wherever you go! Safe travels and thanks for everything, Gill'   Gillian and family - July 2018 Botswana and Zimbabwe "Simply put, it was spectacular." Each camp and area had its own very distinct feel and environment. The standard of service and luxury in the Wildreness camps was overwhelming. We saw... lions, leopards, and even wild dog... And of course on the entire trip we saw countless elephant, hippo, crocodile, buffalo, giraffe, and antelope of all kinds. So really we must thank you for suggesting Zimbabwe and for putting together this trip for us. We were as if spellbound for all of it... We’ll certainly be in touch again when we plan our next trip to Africa.'
