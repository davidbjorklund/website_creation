We have the benefit of not being underneath the flight path so there is no noticeable aircraft noise. Secure parking is also available, please see here for prices. Free transfers are provided if parking with us. All rooms are en-suite and feature memory foam beds with good quality linen. Rooms also include Free wifi and free tea & coffee making facilities. We are not ideal for weekend getaways or wedding parties due to the nature of being a 24h airport business. We do not have an on-site restaurant or bar, although there are several pubs offering food close-by, none are walk able due to lack of pavements. Unfortunately we do not offer any type of breakfast as most guests are leaving in the early hours, however there are several options at the airport.
