The building was built in the 1700’s and very much smaller than it is today. It was renovated and built bigger in the beginning of the 1900’s, and that’s when it acquired its neoclassical style. In general, it is a building combined with educated and traditional island factors. The rooms, therefore, overlooking the courtyards are much more simple giving you the feeling of island’s simplicity rather than the heavy classy rooms on the 1st floor with its high painted ceilings… The building is made of stone and the most characteristical point of the building is its magnificent painted ceilings which highly decorate the living room and some of the rooms upstairs (1st floor). The hotel has 9 rooms and one suite made of two double rooms, all of which have private w.c. and shower, central heating for the winter and air-conditioning for the summer and TV. In 1987 the Aeginitiko Archontiko was taken over by Mr. Fotis Voulgarakis who renovated the whole building and converted it into an A’ class traditional hotel. Aeginitiko Archontiko is open all year round. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Characteristics Crown rating: A' Category Open: All year round Total number of rooms: 12 Total number of beds: 20 end .et_pb_widget Contact Details Ag.Nikolaou & Thomaidou 1 Aegina Town, Saronic, 180 10 Email: aeginitikoarchontiko@gmail.com Telephone: +30-22970-24968 Mobile: +30-698-301-6003 Fax: +30-22970-26716 end .et_pb_widget .et_pb_widget_area .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section .entry-content .et_pb_post #main-content Facebook .container #main-footer #et-main-area #page-container
