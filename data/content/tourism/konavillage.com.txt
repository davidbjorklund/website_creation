Spanning 81 acres of stunning geologic landscape and richness, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort will draw inspiration from the history of the site, local culture and natural elements. Conceptualized and developed by intrepid explorer Johnno Jackson in the early 1960’s, the original Kona Village Resort was best known for its free-standing, palm thatch roof hales and tranquil location. However, the history of the Kona Coast dates back long before it became a one-of-a-kind vacation destination. Inhabited nearly 1,000 years ago, the site was once home to migrating settlers from Polynesia. Located less than 10 miles north of the Kona International Airport, Kona Village, A Rosewood Resort will debut 150 unique, standalone guest hales with locally-inspired décor and a privileged sense of seclusion. An array of distinct dining venues, including the original resort’s beloved Shipwreck Bar and Talk Story Bar, will offer elevated yet relaxed experiences. The resort will also offer an array of new amenities including Sense, A Rosewood Spa, a state-of-the-art fitness facility, as well as multiple pools. Devoted to preserving the heritage of the destination, the resort will feature a cultural center that will grant both locals and visitors access to extensive Hawaiian lineage, providing a link between the resort and its surroundings.
