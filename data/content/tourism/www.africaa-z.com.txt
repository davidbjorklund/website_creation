We specialize in South Africa holidays but have expanded to our neighbors to assist our clients plan their full itinerary.     Africa A-Z offers customized (tailor-made packages designed around your requirements) or scheduled tours (set departure dates with other people) in South & East Africa with our main focus being on South Africa holiday & safaris. We assist our clients and agents to book packages including private and customized safaris, weddings, honeymoons, conferences and incentives.   After more than 10 years in operation, we are experts as safari, wedding and honeymoon planners with many happy customers who use us repeatedly (and refer their families and friends). To see country information, suggested holiday itineraries, safaris, special offers, wedding or honeymoon packages; visit: Botswana , Kenya , Lesotho , Madagascar , Malawi , Mauritius , Mozambique , Namibia , Reunion , Seychelles , South Africa , Swaziland , Tanzania , Uganda , Zambia , Zanzibar and Zimbabwe .   Africa is a safe continent especially when your itinerary is well planned . Our aim is to ensure you ARE SAFE, FEEL SAFE and go home as an ambassador of Africa and Africa A-Z. Hotel booking sites cannot offer you in depth information and knowledge on the areas you are wanting to visit which makes Africa A-Z the best choice for planning your trip (planning an African safari/vacation is not like planning a trip to a large city and you don't want to end up in stressful situations while on your trip/honeymoon etc). What's more is we often can give you better prices than the booking engines (the more you book the better rates we are able to give) and we also give free quotes , so email us with your request and you will be pleasantly surprised at what we can offer.   We design and manage Africa tour packages on behalf of our direct clients and tour operators or agents from all corners of the world, acting as a full service ground handler in Southern Africa. We aim to create packages that integrate smoothly with the available air and land transport options; minimizing any downtime you would normally experience waiting for transfers/flights etc (this can waste not only hours but sometimes even adds extra nights onto itineraries if you are not aware of best routes/options). We have access to all the service providers for tours, safaris and accommodation in Africa and can source the best quotes based on your requirements and budget. Africa A-Z can assist you to make your African safari or holiday/vacation a once-in-a-lifetime experience and at NO EXTRA COST TO YOU . In fact, our clients/agents save valuable time and money by booking through us and we are on hand 24/7 to assist before and throughout your trip. Although we are based in Johannesburg, South Africa; we have the same (or better) rates as operators in Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda etc so give us a try and see for yourself - you've got nothing to lose as we give obligation free quotes . Due to high costs of transferring money across Africa (which we don't charge you for), we do become even more competitive when booking your full itinerary with us. We customize safaris and tours anywhere in Africa even if no information is detailed on this site so email us now for your individual safari or vacation package quotation. Africa A-Z thrives on customer service and referrals so you can be sure that we will give you the best service no matter what type of itinerary you are looking for. We frequently travel in Africa so we can provide you with the best advice unique to your requirements and budget. With our hands-on approach we strive to provide you with the best African Vacation and the best service. Our clients are mostly from USA, Canada, Australia and Europe (including UK) so all the itineraries and special offers are applicable for International visitors to Africa (not for locals although they often request for us to arrange these offers for them as some of them are better than what is available to residents of Africa). Africa A-Z will customize your safari or vacation to Africa finding you the most suitable accommodation and tours. We arrange all types of safaris including budget or luxury safaris, African honeymoons & weddings, School educational tours or sporting tours, conferences and incentives or beach holidays!
