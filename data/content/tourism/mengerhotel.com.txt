The suite was very nice and well appointed. We had a few drinks at the bar and enjoyed the great service and were wowed with the beautiful wooden bar. The bar staff and management made our night very memorable. Carlos C “Wonderful Venue” We had a conference here and really enjoyed the stay. The rooms were nice. The service was wonderful and the food was amazing. I have to highly recommend this historical hotel for a small conference. To be honest, I can't really think of anything to complain about. 109phillipn “Wonderful historic hotel!” Ask for one of the old rooms. The new wing is fine and lovely, but if you stay at this hotel you should sleep in as much history as possible. It's a grand old dame with wonderful amenities and an excellent location. You are literally across the alley from the Alamo! Gogoinspectorgadget "Historic hotel with fantastic staff" The Menger is an historic hotel right next to the Alamo and so close to shopping and the River Walk. The hotel staff could not have been more accommodating and pleasant. If you are planning a trip to San Antonio this hotel has it all - great location, history, wonderful staff, and a fantastic restaurant on-site. Marsha P "Excellent service from check-in to check-out" Everyone was helpful and friendly. The hotel was spotless and its location is excellent for seeing the Alamo, Riverwalk, and Hemisphere Plaza. I was always given helpful directions and information, my room was comfortable, and the historic integrity of the hotel was pleasantly obvious. I was there for a conference and meals and set-up were done seamlessly with an attentive staff and excellent food. There were never issues with technology either, so meetings proceeded on schedule.
