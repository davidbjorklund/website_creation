Seven miles upriver from the Pacific, Taylor's offers a RV park, marina and restaurant on the water. Residents and guest may walk out their door, stop for breakfast on the dock and step into their boats for a day's salmon fishing. Taylor's Landing is just minutes from the services located in Yachats, Waldport and   Newport. Just across the river however, beaver, otter, mink, deer, elk, and bear may be seen. Blue and green herons play their trade as the best fisherman on the river while eagles and osprey look down from their lofty perches atop ancient Sitka Spruce. In late summer the famous Blueback enter the Alsea  and they are soon followed by Chinook Salmon and Coho. In December steelhead make a showing and all of them must swim under the docks at Taylor's. Nearby Alsea Bay provides some of the best Dungeness crabbing in the world. The bay also offers clamming at low tides while the Pacific beaches provide abundant razor clams. Taylor's central location allows fishermen to boat or drive to ocean , bay, estuary, tidewater or river fisheries within minutes. Chinook salmon may literally  be caught right off the dock. Downriver, the bay beckons while a trip upstream offers riverine highway beneath broad leaf and conifer canopies. In the fall our residents are in their boats at first light. After the tide has changed they are back at the dock preparing the day's catch to be enjoyed in their RV's  or saved for the dinner table at home. Taylor's Landing offers complete full hook-up for RV's. Rental boats and motors are available if you don't have one of your own. Boats up to 20 feet may be moored at the dockside and many salmon are landed every year as the restaurant patrons watch from their tables just inches above the river. Clean and well maintained showers and restroom facilities are available if you choose and a laundry room is available in the same building. Ice and bait are also available at the park. A fire pit area accommodates the family style pot lucks that take place in the summer and early fall evenings. Taylor's Landing offers a chance to get close to nature as you choose. All the facilities are available on a daily, weekly or monthly basis and the fees are modest. Most of the guest have been coming here for years and everyone is on a first name basis. Give it a try and make your reservations early to assure a spot in our little slice of Heaven. $img %ImageAssetImpl:/images/Alsea_Salmon_05_029_1_.jpgboats.jpg$ $img %ImageAssetImpl:/images/Alsea_Salmon_05_034_1_.jpgmark.jpg$ $addOn town=Waldport, OR addOn=resource\:/resources/addons/yahooMap/yahooMap.addon element.icon=resource\:/resources/addons/yahooMap/icon-small.gif street=7164 Alsea Hwy description= style=small publish.local=false $ $begin exclude$ $end exclude$ Call or email Phone :   541-528-3388 Email;  Taylorslanding@peak.org TAYLOR'S LANDING RV PARK AND MARINA $navbar name=used.nav assetID=%NavbarAsset:/navigation_bars/used.nav $ $begin exclude$ $end exclude$ $img %ImageAssetImpl:/images/park_7.JPG$ $img %ImageAssetImpl:/images/relaxing_dinners.jpg$ $begin exclude$ $end exclude$
