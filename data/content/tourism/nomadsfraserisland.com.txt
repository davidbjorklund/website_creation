"Loved it! Had the best group and our guide was awesome. My favourite part of the trip was Lake Wabby, watch out for the catfish! The 4x4 driving was so much fun. It was really cool seeing Dingos on the island too. My favourite trip on the East Coast so far." Craig OVERALL A GREAT EXPERIENCE! "I had an awesome time on Fraser island with a very busy three days. Lake Mckenzie is beautiful but the champagne pools, Eli creek and Indian Heads are equally amazing. There is great banter between the cars and excellent guides. Overall a great experience!" Katie MORE THAN I'D HOPED FOR! “This trip was even more than I’d hoped for - our guide was legendary and exceeded all expectations. He introduced us to Lake McKenzie, Lake Wabby, the Maheno Shipwreck, to name a few. We learned tons of cultural info, visited incredible sites each day and then got to hang out and party by night – a perfect balance of awesome.” Jenna VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY! "The Fraser island trip by Nomads was my first tour on my east coast travels and by far the best way to start my trip! You definitely get your value for money and a fun-filled busy three days. The highlight for me was of course Lake Mckenzie. The whole trip is magical. Excellent guide, excellent views, excellent trip!" #bedingosafe Cecily I REALLY ENJOYED IT! "I really enjoyed my time on Fraser. It was a great social experience. I made a lot of good friends who I continued to meet up with in Australia after our Fraser tour. It is definitely the best trip I've done since starting my travels!" Rob IT WON'T DISAPPOINT! "I personally had a great time on this tour. Everything is arranged from breakfast to dinner and the 4x4 rides on the beach are really amazing. For sure everyone will make friends with the group you are travelling with. Best advice for everyone: just relax and enjoy everything this tour has to offer, it won't disappoint!"
