The rooms are spacious and the wifi is free. Friendly team, brilliant shower and good location made this a good stay. There was no charge to use the laundry facilities either, which was a bonus. Good value for money. We would stay again. Helen, Wellington We were in Christchurch for the Toruk Show, at the Horncastle Arena.This motel is the closest to the Venue, 10mins walk. The motel is older, but nice and tidy and clean in the Units. Linen was nice, and the room had a good heater as was cold and wet outside. potterp183 We stayed here for two nights as we were in town for a concert. This motel was within a short walking distance to the stadium which is why we choose it. The one-bedroom unit was comfortable and spacious. It was clean, warm and had everything we needed. joken630 We were placed in this motel one day prior to arrival when original motel had painting issues. Room clean and comfortable and we were given a free ride to railway station for trip on the transalpine train. 7:45 start. Excellent , friendly service.
