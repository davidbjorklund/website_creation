It offers high quality services that radiate the traditional hospitality of the Greek islands and is fully equipped with all modern amenities necessary for relaxing holidays. Since July 2005, when Aeolos opened its doors to the public, our target remains the same; the satisfaction of our guests. A typical day at Aeolos starts with the fresh and delicious breakfast we offer and continues either at some nearby marvellous beach or by the pool where sunbathing and dives can be combined with refreshing cocktails at the pool bar. All our guests have to do is to relax and enjoy every moment in the little paradise of Koufonisi. Aeolos is located in the center of the island, only 200 meters away from the port. From the hotel one can walk to almost all beaches and sites of the island. The hotel also offers private parking space.
