The accommodation is excellent, its quiet and peaceful, the welcome warm, and the breakfast always excellent. The scenery round about is wonderful and the walking trail system keeps us coming back. Guest 2013 http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g57441-d586716-Reviews-Millstone_Hill_Barn_and_Lodge-Websterville_Vermont.html – TripAdvisor Came highly recommended and lived up to reputation in every way. Great view, warm hospitality, cozy room with good linens, excellent and amply breakfast. A beautifully reconstructed barn with hand-finished beams. And just out the door: miles of beautiful hiking/biking trails that lead among old quarries and “grout piles,” huge hills of unused granite slabs. We will come back!

I would highly recommend the Inn. Situated along a dirt road not too far off of 89…the Inn was perfect for our wedding party to stay all weekend for our rehearsal dinner, reception and brunch. The brunch provided by Pierre, Inn co-owner, was nothing short of amazing! Frankie his sister and co-owner was very communicative throughout the planning process. Perfect. Sarah, Bride 2015 https://www.theknot.com/marketplace/millstone-hill-barre-vt-357883 – The Knot The location is beautiful and has many opportunities for beauty year-round. The lodge has 5 rooms (b&b style) for your wedding party/friends to stay in. There is also a small lower cabin for rent as well. Its a great place to have a wedding weekend, especially if you love the outdoors. there are walking/hiking paths around the quarries. There is also a banquet hall you can rent for the rehearsal dinner. Leslie, Bride 2010 My family & I booked the banquet room for a Holiday get together. The room and kitchen were immaculate. The temperature in the room was perfect. We could not get over the gorgeous views and the grounds were perfect for a family whiffle ball game (yes, it was a warm day in Dec). The owner stuck his head in at dusk to turn on lights & to be sure we had everything we needed. Great Experience… Cris 2015 http://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotel_Review-g57441-d586716-Reviews-Millstone_Hill_Barn_and_Lodge-Websterville_Vermont.html – TripAdvisor My sister and our families stayed at the Lodge for 2 nights when we were in town for a commital service. Our family rented all the rooms at The Lodge at a very fair rate. The Lodge is quite convenient especially to the Barre-Montpelier area and other surrounding areas. It was easy to find. The Lodge itself was just great. A very nice floorplan for families with large sitting areas and also smaller, private sitting areas. The kitchen was VERY well stocked with utensils, pots, pans, spices, dishes, stemware and so on. We are grateful to Pierre for maintaining this property and it is obvious he has taken great care to see that his guests are comfortable in this well appointed B&B. We experienced a wonderful time at The Lodge and would give it our highest recommendation.
