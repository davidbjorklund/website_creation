Cleanup made easy - whether it is solvent based or water borne; contained in an open top tank, drum or tote we have the washer to clean it.  High pressure combined with high volume allows our DW-100 , TW-100 and TW-300 washers to get the job done safely and efficiently. We Complete the Cycle is more than just an engineered solution or design perspective, but a philosophy of enhancing our customer's competitive performance and improving bottom lines.  Our Closed Loop Systems illustrate that completely.  Once the cleaning has been completed by either of our DW-100 , TW-100 or TW-300 washers the clean and dirty solvents are processed in and out of our storage tanks and then reclaimed by our solvent recovery unit .  CB Mills' closed loop system provides a simple solution to a time consuming and costly process.
