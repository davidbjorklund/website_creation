Modern air-hardening steels are characterized by low distortion during heat treatment because of their high-chromium content. Their machinability is good and they have a balance of wear resistance and toughness (i.e. between the D- and shock-resistant grades). Grades CTS Powder Metal About CTS Powder Metal Reduced manufacturing costs to the tool producer and improved machinability in the annealed condition. Grades CTS Square About CTS Square Grades Shock Resistance About Shock Resistance Grades Oil Hardening About Oil Hardening This series includes an O1 type, an O2 type, an O6 type and an O7 type. All steels in this group are typically hardened at 800 degrees celsius, oil quenched, then tempered at ?200C.</span Grades Alloy About Alloy Steels Grades Drill Rod About Drill Rod Grades High Carbon/High Chrome About High Carbon/High Chrome Grades Mold Quality/Hot Work About Mold Quality/Hot Work Grades Water Hardening About Water Hardening W-group tool steel gets its name from its defining property of having to be water quenched. W-grade steel is essentially high carbon  plain-carbon steel . This group of tool steel is the most commonly used tool steel because of its low cost compared to others. They work well for small parts and applications where high temperatures are not encountered; above 150  degrees Celsius (302 degrees Fahrenheit) it begins to soften to a noticeable degree. Its  hardenability  is low, so W-group tool steels must be subjected to a rapid quenching, requiring the use of water. These steels can attain high hardness (above HRC 66) and are rather brittle compared to other tool steels.
