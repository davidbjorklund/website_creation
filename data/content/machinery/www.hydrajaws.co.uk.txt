HYDRAJAWS TRAINING There has been a major increase in the use of testers, particularly with local authorities who demand that a specific testing programme should be carried out on site by the contractor which is then endorsed by recorded evidence.  It is therefore essential that all such site personnel should be thoroughly familiar with the use and understanding of testing equipment, especially if you have recently purchased a Pull Test Kit for Scaffold Anchors or any tester in our range. In this respect Hydrajaws offers an operator training scheme and issues certificates of competence which are recognised by local authorities and others in the industry. SCAFFOLDING - MAKE SURE IT'S SECURE! Hydrajaws construction safety products, including scaffold safety equipment, used in conjunction with the Hydrajaws Bluetooth Digital System can provide reassurance and confidence in the building and erecting of scaffold systems.
