Most of the products that shape our lives have been manufactured or tested with equipment supplied by the TPS family of brands. From industrial ovens, furnaces, pharmaceutical sterilizers, and laboratory ovens to environmental temperature chambers and stability test chambers, TPS products provide thermal processing and test solutions for a range of industries. These industries include defense, aerospace, electronics, biotech, medical, pharmaceutical, lab animal science, energy, transportation, communications, commercial heat treating, die casting, agriculture, and materials processing to name a few. Take a moment to watch a brief overview video on the many products that are manufactured or tested in a TPS piece of equipment. Industrial Ovens From composite curing ovens to epoxy curing ovens, TPS has a vast range of top performance industrial ovens for your application. With maximum temperature uniformity, superior heat ramp up and recovery, and over-temperature protection, our industrial ovens are ideal for powder coat curing, annealing and more. Choose from mechanical convection, inert gas, top-loading or bench ovens. Learn More Drying Ovens TPS has both Gruenberg and Blue M ovens for composite drying, pharmaceutical granulation drying, hardening synthetic materials and more. Superior airflow and temperature capabilities ensure uniform moisture removal, while a range of models with HEPA filtration, NFPA 86 Class B and inert atmosphere features meet the toughest industry requirements and safety standards.  Learn More Environmental Test Chambers Our environmental chambers simulate a range of conditions, including extreme temperature, humidity, altitude and vacuum environments. TPS environmental chambers can also provide thermal shock testing, steady state testing, stability testing and shelf life testing. Standard and custom models are available in benchtop, reach-in or walk-in test chamber configurations. Learn More Refurbished and Rental Equipment In 2004, TPS recognized that the industry lacked a source for high quality used and refurbished environmental chambers and ovens. Sure, there are many sellers of TPS used and refurbished equipment, but the quality of this equipment was not up to par with our expectations. For this reason TPS decided that it was time to enter the refurbished equipment market. What started with a desire to service our smaller and short notice customers has grown to make us a major player in the refurbished environmental equipment market. Learn More Pharmaceutical Sterilizers and Dryers Our industrial sterilizers and depyrogenation ovens ensure pharmaceutical products and medical devices meet the strictest requirements. Extreme uniformity, dry heat sterilization, inert atmosphere, HEPA filtration and short cycle times are just a few of the benefits of TPS sterilizers. We also have the capabilities to produce completely custom ovens and sterilizers to meet your exact processing needs. Learn More Lab Furnaces Our lab furnaces are used in many applications and are designed to function within a range of temperature zones. Learn More Custom Industrial Ovens The engineers at TPS can design a custom oven or chamber that meets your application’s unique challenges and strict requirements.
