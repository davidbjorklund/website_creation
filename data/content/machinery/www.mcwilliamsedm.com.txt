It is the process of electrically removing hard material from a conductive material. This is achieved by applying high-frequency, pulsed, DC current to the workpiece through (a) an electrode, (b) wire, or (c) a copper or brass tube, which melts and vaporizes the workpiece material (approximately 7,500 degrees), coupled with a servo-drive. An electrode never touches the workpiece but discharges it's current through an insulating dielectric fluid (water or oil) across a varying small spark gap. This spark vaporizes and melts the workpiece material. The servo-system controls this spark gap. McWilliam specializes in Sodick EDM, Japax EDM, Seibu EDM, Gromax EDM, and  KTC EDM machines. These machines include Wire EDM, vertical, Ram and conventional EDM, Small Hole EDM and EDM Tap Busters, and portable EDM Machines. We are also the worldwide single source for Japax parts.
