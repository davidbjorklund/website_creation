It is used for pre-packing screening or sieving/sifting , removal of foreign material/impurities and lumps from powders like flour, spices, chemicals, minerals, food stuff etc. This configuration is also well suited for filtration of liquids and slurries like mineral slurry, wash water, effluent, oil, back water, syrups and juices. / title-wrap Separation & Filtration Eta Vibro Screen® fitted with special anti clogging ball/ ring tray and dust cover are used for screening of fine powders from fine mesh. The anti-clogging arrangement provides continuous tapping of mesh for declogging the mesh holes and ensures smooth screening operation. The dust cover is provided to minimize the atmospheric dusting. This configuration is useful for minerals, ground spices, chemicals, polymer powders, PVC etc. / title-wrap Fine Powder Screening Eta Vibro Screen® in double deck configuration works as a grader or classifier. The material fed on the first screen gets classified into three different grades depending on the two screens fitted in the machine. This configuration is most useful to achieve a precise grade of granular product like polymer granules, seeds and grains, cereals/lentils and nuts, pesticide granules, crystals, chips and flakes. The modular design permits mounting of more than two screens depending upon the application and machine model. / title-wrap Grading and Classification Materials We Process /entry #content / row /skinset-main /content-wrapper /wrapper Contact Detail ETA Engineering Services Plot No. 3/2 Ambica Estate, Nr.
