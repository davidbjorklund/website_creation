United Textile Machinery Corporation was founded in the early 1950's by the late Emil Shapiro and the late Leon Bakst. At the untimely death of Emil Shapiro in December 1969, the company changed hands and began to operate under the direction of Samuel Shapiro. Since then, the company has grown tremendously and now conducts business worldwide. We have increased our warehouse and storage capabilities to more than five times its original capacity. United Textile Machinery Corporation enjoys working worldwide, with not only fellow dealers, but also with a network of customers and clientele, both inside and outside of the textile industry.
