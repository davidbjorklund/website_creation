OUTER PAGE TABLE PICTURE AND BAR TABLE END PICTURE TABLE SPLIT TABLE LEFT SIDEBAR AREA START CONTENT TABLE Welcome: PARAGRAPH 1 Consultant Hydrauliuc Design Engineer, PETER WRIGHT ASSOCIATES was formed in 1992 to provide a design service to companies requiring hydraulic design and/or mechanical design, this has now expanded to provide pure mechanical design, which can include both computer and PLC control. There are very few companies that can combine both mechanical and hydraulic design. Hydraulic companies are usually too busy to do any more than design a hydraulic system and no more, mechanical design companies usually do not have any experienced hydraulic design engineers. So if you require a machine, no matter how large or small, to be designed, and/or manufactured which includes hydraulic and/or mechanical design contact PETER WRIGHT ASSOCIATES The pictures on the right are just a selection of some of the projects completed in the past, from quite large (many Tonnes) to very small (just a few Grammes).
