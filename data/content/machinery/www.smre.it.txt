The company was to set up a complete production line for roller blinds and was looking for a solution to automate the process and create a high quality product of variable dimensions in less than 2 minutes. The finished product had to be strong (seams had to be very well welded) and particularly attractive – the aesthetic component of the product was as important as the strength. The edges of the fabric – in PVC coated fiber glass – has to be very cleanly cut, and the cut had to be seared. The lower pocket-with-keder was going to be visible in the finished product and had to be of superior quality. The tolerance of the diagonals on the finished product had to be less than 2 mm. The machine was to accommodate rolls of various weights and dimensions.
