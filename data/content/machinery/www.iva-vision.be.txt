Line scanning offers unlimited pixels in the direction of a web's motion with zero smear even at high speeds, higher dynamic range, greater processing efficiency and much lower price/pixel. Line scan cameras 100% real time inspection at high product speeds requires huge amounts of data to be processed in milliseconds. Our cameras use FPGA-circuits to preprocess this data already in hardware. This data is sent to the main CPU at speeds up to 3Gb/s. Highly efficient vision algorythms verify these images for presence of possible defects and classify them into predefined categories. High speed data processing The system is compact and easy to retrofit on existing production lines. A typical installation and set-up takes 1 to 2 days. After 1 hour of training, an operator is capable to work with the system. An in-depth training to know all the features of the system and to enable you to do the complete installation and set-up of the system, only takes 1 day. Easy installation and operation ​ Increase your production quality and reduce down-times with our high performance web inspection systems.
