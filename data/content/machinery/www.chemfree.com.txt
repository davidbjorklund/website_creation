Introducing the award-winning CRC SmartWasher ® Bioremediating Parts-Washing System A proven leader in the parts washing industry, and made in the U.S.A., the proprietary bioremediating CRC SmartWasher ® is safe to use, cost effective and a powerful cleaner – the ultimate solution to cleaning parts without using hazardous solvents. The CRC SmartWasher ® parts washing systems employ a natural process called bioremediation to eliminate liquid hazardous waste streams, reduce the release of harmful pollutants and increase employee safety. The CRC SmartWasher ®  system combines three essential components: the SmartWasher® which is the actual parts washer, a powerful water-based degreasing solution called OzzyJuice ® , and a microbe impregnated particulate trap called an OzzyMat ® . The combination of these three remarkable products not only defines the  CRC SmartWasher ® parts cleaning system but also produces one truly amazing “Smart Washer”. Parts Washer Overview Through the process of bioremediation our CRC SmartWasher ® parts washers give you the powerful cleaning performance of solvents without any of the hazardous by-products. The OzzyMat ® , the most important part of the CRC SmartWasher ® system, is a proprietary particulate trap impregnated with natural occurring microbes we call Ozzys ® . These Ozzy Microbes effectively break down grease, oil and other carbon-based contaminants into harmless carbon dioxide and water. OzzyJuice ® degreasing solutions are pH neutral, non-flammable, non-toxic, non-polluting, do not cause skin irritations, and will work as quickly as a premium solvent.
