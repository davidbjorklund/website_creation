The durability, ease of use and low maintenance of the Strauch line is ideal for those running or planning to start a cottage-industry business. All About Strauch Fiber In 1991 we began making hand crafted floor Swift/Skeinwinders. As our hobby grew we wanted to expand. In March of 2000 we purchased the drum carding portion of a small west coast company and formed Strauch Fiber Equipment Co. The many improvements we've made to the original drum carder design have been so well received by the fiber arts community that the series of Strauch drum carders have become "The Standard of the Industry". The Jumbo Ball Winder was added in 2005, and in 2007 we introduced our series of table model Swift/skeinwinders to complement our original line of floor models. A quantum leap was made in 2008 with the introduction of motorized drum carders .     Our fiber milling and fiber processing products are Proudly Made in the USA. As part of our company mission Strauch Fiber Equipment Co. is dedicated to promoting American made products. Where possible, the components we use to manufacture our products are made in the USA. We even specify that the wood we use comes from U.S. forests. We Reduce waste, Reuse, and Recycle. Over 90% of our packing paper and foam peanuts are given to us by local retailers who would rather not feed the landfill. The minimal amount of wood scrap that we generate is used to heat our workshop. We compost the sawdust and the wood shavings are used as animal bedding. Strauch Fiber Equipment Company is committed to organizations that help people become independent, improve themselves and their communities. To this end we support groups such as Heifer International and 4-H. <div style="valign:bottom;"></div> <div style="float:left; width:28%;"> <img src="images/sm-finest.png" alt="" border="0" width="100%" /> </div> <div style="float:left; width:28%;"> <img src="images/sm-ballWinder.png" alt="" border="0" width="100%" /> </div> <div style="float:left; width:13%;"> <img src="images/sm-swiftMini.png" alt="" border="0" width="100%" /> </div> <div style="float:left; width:28%;"> <img src="images/sm-handCards.png" alt="" border="0" width="100%" /> </div> <div class="clearfix"></div> </div> Check out our latest blog post "Mike’s Fiber Journal: Kentucky Sheep & Fiber Festival and Blue Ridge Fiber Fest" Thursday 11th July, 2019 Sign up for our newsletter <script type="text/javascript" src="https://www.formstack.com/forms/js.php?1911897-3Ym8GyJmVM-v3&amp;jsonp"></script><noscript><a href="https://www.formstack.com/forms/?1911897-3Ym8GyJmVM" title="Online Form">Online Form - Constant Contact Signup Form</a></noscript><div style="text-align:right; font-size:x-small;padding-bottom:10px;"><a href="http://www.formstack.com?utm_source=jsembed&utm_medium=product&utm_campaign=product+branding&fa=h,1911897" title="Online Form Builder">Online Form Builder</a></div> <div align="center"><br /><a href="https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=bzlby6oab&amp;p=oi&amp;m=1115542302497&amp;sit=jymkouiib&amp;f=a350dd18-8090-46ff-9858-269e6156b47e" target="_blank" class="button" style="background-color: rgb(232, 232, 232); border: 1px solid rgb(91, 91, 91); color: rgb(91, 91, 91); display: inline-block; padding: 8px 10px; text-shadow: none; border-radius: 10px;">Sign Up Now</a> <div id="ctct_button_footer" align="center" style="font-family:Arial,Helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:10px;color:#999999;margin-top: 10px;">For Email Marketing you can trust.</div></div> Begin CTCT Sign-Up Form EFD 1.0.0 [Tue Mar 21 10:40:45 EDT 2017] Thanks for signing up!
