They were designed by Dane Scag, founder of both the Bob Cat and Scag companies. Great Dane was founded in 1996 and purchased by the John Deere Group in 2000. Great Dane zero turn mowers are the professional's choice. Their ability to "turn on a sixpence" makes them particularly suitable for obstacle courses, cutting much faster and reducing the need to trim, due to their manoeuvrability. All Great Dane mowers can be supplied with side or rear discharge, mulch decks and can collect the grass if required. We can also convert them to run on cheap and readily available Calor LPG . Call us for a free demonstration or click here to find your nearest supplier . Also ask us about our special low-cost finance deals. You could be the proud owner of a Great Dane mower for just £50 a week.
