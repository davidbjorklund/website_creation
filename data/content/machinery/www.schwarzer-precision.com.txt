With such a donation, we will give children all over the world a chance for a better future.</em></p> <p>Most refugee children have to leave their home hastily. For their dangerous flight, they leave everything behind. All that remains of the belongings that they once had  books, toys or clothes  is a sad memory. </p> <p>UNICEF helps those children with clean drinking water and medicine, winter clothes and heating fuel as well as tent schools, toys and teaching materials.</p> <p>This year again, Schwarzer Precision supports the &quot;Donations Instead of Gifts&quot; campaign actively. Therefore, we will transfer the full amount that was intended for Christmas presents for our customers to the UNICEF children's centres. For the most beautiful Christmas present is a child's smile.</p> <p><a href="https://www.unicef.de/spendenstattschenken" target="_blank">UNICEF-Website &quot;Donations Instead of Gifts&quot;</a></p> </div> // Page Navigation english us-english deutsch français italiano español português   HAUPTNAVI INKLUDIEREN // Main Navigation Products Gas / Air pumps EC Eccentric Diaphragm Pumps Series 100 Series 200 Series 500 Series 600 Series 700   RO Rotary Diaphragm Pumps FZ Miniature Vane Pumps LI Linear Diaphragm Pumps PA Pivot Armature Pumps SA Vibrating Diaphragm Pumps Liquid Pumps   EC-L Eccentric Diaphragm Pumps   Series 200-L Series 500-L Series 600-L Series 700-L   RO-L Rotary Diaphragm Pumps <li><a href="bauart.php?g=8" class="ende">SA-L Vibrating Diaphragm Pumps</a></li> //         Accessories Product Overview   Applications Medical technology Environmental and analysis technology Automotive technology Safety technology Inkjet and reprographic technology Industrial engineering Food industry Air-condition and energy technology Company Quality Modular Production Consultation + Service Environmental Protection Social Commitment Timeline Our Customers Jobs Media News Newsletter Videos Downloads Contact Product Inquiry E-Mail SP Germany Sales Partners Your Opinion HAUPTNAVI ENDE // micro pumps Schwarzer Precision GmbH + Co.
