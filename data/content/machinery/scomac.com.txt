DIAMOND TOOLS FOR ALL APPLICATIONS. SCOMAC INC. A BRIEF BACKGROUND SCOMAC Inc. remains an American founded family business. The past 30 years have been exciting and challenging. We have assisted in the design and manufacture of diamond tools for the windows of spacecraft. From the first one and two man vehicles, to the shuttles and now the space station. The government "starwars" project came along in the 80's and we were invited to work on space mirrors, sattelites and space telescopes. Our work on defense missles and guidance systems continues. In the mix, since the beginning, has been the development of diamond tools for camera, scopes and laser lenses, auto, aircraft and marine windows. The 90's brought new challenges. The fibre optics revolution with it's requirement for precision tooling for the photonics industry on which it so heavily relys. The electronics industry and it's ever changing demand for diamond tools for cutting, edging and surfacing of chips, wafers and magnetic heads. Scomac continues on into the 21st century with a vast background of knowledge learned in the past and a great enthusiasm for the challenges that we are sure to face in the future. OUR PRODUCT LINES The majority of our products are manufactured only after review of the application with our customer. Correct diamond types and sizes, bond or matrix systems, diamond concentrations, special shapes, forms and tolerances, are all considered and then put into sketch or print form. We do not provide "off the shelf" diamond tools but rather tooling made to our customer's specifications based on the material being machined and the process in place or under development. DIAMOND GENERATING TOOLS, BLANCHARD TYPE HORIZONTAL SURFACING RINGS, COMBINATION CENTERING/BEVELING WHEELS, DIAMOND PELLETS FOR SURFACING AND RECONDITIONING OF POLY PADS, SOLID CONCAVE, CONVEX AND PLANO LAPS, CORE DRILLS, CNC MILLING TOOLS, MOUNTED COUNTERSINKS, COUNTERBORES, SLOTTING AND RADIUS TOOLS, BALL TOOLS, PENCILEDGE WHEELS, SEAMING WHEELS, SPECIAL EDGE FORMING WHEELS, "V" GROOVE WHEELS, SEGMENTS, HONES, AND THIN DICING BLADES AND DISCS are among a few of the many products that we provide. DIAMOND TOOL DESIGN PRECISION FORMS AND TOLERANCES OTHER SERVICES THAT WE OFFER: SCOMAC developed the EDM machining of diamond tools in 1973. Our experience in this process allows us to manufacture diamond tools with intricate shapes and forms. This tooling can be returned to Scomac for reforming and redressing at a nominal charge. We offer a Redress/Retrue service for all conventional diamond tools, regardless of manufacturer. In many cases we are able to adapt exisitng tooling to different equipment, either by machining or exchanging adaptors from our wide inventory.
