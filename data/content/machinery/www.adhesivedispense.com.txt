FMI dispensers and metering pumps have been utilised in a broad range of laboratory, analytical, industrial process, and OEM applications requiring precision fluid metering.  With accuracies better than ± 0.5% and consistent precise output with all FMI pumps. Accuracy is held from micro litres to the full flow range. Output does not change more than ± 1% of set value. An important cost saving factor considering the waste generated by inaccurate pumps. FMI pumps have no valves to clog, leak, hang up or service, maintenance and down time are considerably reduced and with ceramic internals, which are wear and abrasion resistant as well as having corrosion resistant fluid paths, means Superior material stability will provide millions of service free cycles.  We now also feature the exciting Zaxis metering pumps which add an additional servo drive to the pump stroke giving the ultimate in controllability, repeatability and accuracy.

LIQUIDYN Micro Dispensing Systems are designed for applications where accurate and repetitive volumes of material need to be dispensed in volumes ranging from 3 nanolitres and up either as repetitive high speed multiple micro dots, beads or fixed volumes. The P-Jet CT Micro Jet Dispenser can deliver an astounding 280 micro dots per second with consistent results.. With and ever increasing demand for rapid micro dispensing across all industries, LIQUIDYN have created a niche product which actually works and is more cost effective than more complicated competing systems. Apart from dispensing anaerobic adhesives effectively and quickly, LIQUIDYN dispensers can also dispense high viscosity media such as filled epoxy resins, silicones, fluxes, lacquers and greases, as well as low viscous media such as instant glues, solvents etc Click here to see more about Liquidyn products   AUTHORISED DISTRIBUTOR Fully Programmable Precision CeramPump Metering Pumps Zaxis Inc. VariPump  system combines the user-friendly TSi (Touch Screen Interface) programmable controller and a state-of-the-art FMI metering module. This technology employs extreme tolerance diamond honed ceramic pump components and an electronically controlled linear stepper actuator to make ultra-fine adjustments to pump angle position, thereby changing the quantity of metered liquid. This allows the VariPump  system to provide enhanced fluidic movement of fluids varying in viscosity and surface tension. The pump used in the VariPump  system is a rotating and reciprocating pump design manufactured by FMI. Controlling the synchronized rotating and reciprocating movement allows the TSi controller to accurately maintain the displacement of the piston. With the piston and the sleeve being manufactured from ceramic, the assembly is manufactured to extremely tight tolerances, ensuring accuracy and repeatability. This pump design eliminates the need for external supply and discharge valves; the intake port of the pump is never common to the discharge port. The VariPump  system will change the way industry meters fluids.
