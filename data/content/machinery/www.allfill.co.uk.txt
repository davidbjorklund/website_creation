Milk & Infant Formula We secured another order earlier this year with a leading company producing Milk and Infant formula and specialised nutritional solutions.  The application required our advanced Continuous Motion Rotary Filler (CMR Series) with Tare & Gross weighing system incorporating Top-up and Final Weight Verification, together with our High-Speed Reject. With unparalleled performance, filling at speeds of up to 200 containers per minute, achieving outstanding accuracy and efficiency. This particular system features our open frame design offering the highest levels of hygienic standards. This is just one of the many advantages this system offers, another being the superior accuracy or “minimum give-away” of product that our filling systems continue to offer our clients. The configuration of our system can easily be customised in its design, according to the requirements of the production process of our clients. Integration of the filling system can be combined into an existing filling line or as part of a complete or part filling line supplied by us. With this, and working in co-operation, we maximise our clients’ production value.... WPLP Unknown field: Custom_Fields Read more... Coffee Canning We are pleased to confirm another successful Factory Acceptance Test of a Continuous Motion Rotary machine for a major producer of coffee. The requirements were to fill various types of coffee at fill weights of 170g to 750g into cans at 60 containers per minute. Whilst utilising a standard machine model, the specification was adapted to meet the clients specific engineering standards, it was also supplied with Allen Bradley controls, IP65 protection and to a Zone 22 ATEX rating. The equipment included an integrated check-weigher for 100% inspection and “Active Feedback” to manage filling to the Average Weights Legislation, and to greatly minimise product giveaway.  A “Piano” reject system was also provided to gently separate any out of tolerance containers without any product spillage. Turret and head height adjustment were motorised to allow for different size cans with positions saved as part of a product “recipe” to assist with rapid change over between products and formats. The client had been particularly concerned about the potential of damage to their delicate agglomerated coffee, however we were able to demonstrate with extensive testing that any product degradation was negligible....
