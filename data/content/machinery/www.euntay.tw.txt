Motion Control System--Tension Control,Edge Position Control,Digital DC Motor Drive Expert:Euntay Electric Co., Ltd. Tension Control, Edge Position Control, DC Motor Drive Expert Solution Euntay Electric Co., Ltd. is specialized in Controllerâs research, development and production, providing excellent Motion Control of machinery industry; our products include: Web Tension Control system, Edge Position Control system, Digital DC Motor Drive, to build a complete motion control system to help a variety of mechanical equipment to achieve the goal of â Motion Control â Manufacturer . âWeb Tension control system â are applied to the productions of Fabric, Textiles, Thin films, Paper, Plastics , Rubber, Fiber, Metal foil and other materials, materialâs tension will be changed with the variation of diameter of the reel in the process of unwinding, central guiding and rewinding, through by DigitalâTension Control systemâ, the tension of material could be held and be stable. Digital Tension detector of âWeb Tension Control Systemâ has high tensil strength, low detection linearity error and wide range of tension detection, meanwhile, tension controller selects modular design and uses DSP technology that could provide different control mode, programmable and memorized control modular, which could match different requirement of tension control coming from variety of machinery and materials. Such as Fabric, Textiles, Thin films, Paper, Plastics , Rubber, Fiber, Metal foil. Tension Control system manufactured by Euntay Electric Co., Ltd. develops tension controller equipment with technology of high-resolution digital signal processing and high-precision tension detector equipment , which according to the characteristics of materials, the dynamic variation of material tension and the requirement in the process, providing stable tension control with broad dynamic-range. âEdge position Control Systemâ uses precise edge-position detector, digital controller and equipped with precise drive device, could precisely control edge position of surface-like materialâs forming process in transportation. âEdge position Control Systemâare applied to the productions of Fabric, Textile, Thin film, Paper, Plastic , Rubber, Fiber, Metal foil etc. Owing to “Digital DC Motor Drive” uses microcomputer as control center, it makes control’s precision be higher and the application range is much wider than before. The specification and control mode of “Digital DC Motor Drive” could be programmed (In comparison, analog dc drive can't be programmed easily and it is difficultly applied to different brand of dc motors),because Digital DC Motor Drive's control performance is outstanding, more durable, price is competitive, digital dc motor drive are used generally.   EUNTAY ELECTRIC CO.
