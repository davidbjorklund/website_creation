You can see that as the solid wire enters the "arc", immediately a large ball of molten metal forms on the end of the wire. When the ball reaches a mass that can no longer be supported on the end of the wire- it simply falls into the weld puddle, guided by gravity and the current flow of the welding arc. This process is used in very high speed production welding where the arc length can be held constant, therefore very little splatter is produced.
