Our team of experts is exceptionally knowledgeable, highly integrated, supportive and focused on providing the optimal solution for our client needs. Our team of experts can confidently guide our customers to the precise level of machining that minimizes tool changes and maximizes savings. BACK TO TOP A Family-Owned Business STF Precision Technologies & Tools, Inc. began operations in March 1992, when Ted Ford purchased Norton Company’s High Precision Diamond Product Line. As part of the purchase he acquired an extensive inventory of custom-built diamond lapping and grinding machines as well as an established customer base. Prior to the purchase, Mr. Ford had spent 20 years at Norton and was a recognized expert in diamond tooling. His expertise was evident as he successfully guided the growth of the company from 1992 to 2001. In June 2001, leadership of the company was passed to his son, Jason Ford, who became co-owner and President, and to his son-in-law, David Novak, who was named Vice-President. In addition, the trade name of the organization was changed to STF Precision. In January 2005, STF built and moved into a new, 15,000 SF production facility at 76 Old Shoals Road. Continued growth demanded another expansion in 2015, and STF began construction of an additional 40,000 SF facility. The new headquarters were opened in 2015, where STF’s 75+ craftsmen continue to produce quality diamond tooling for national and international customers. State of the Art Facility STF’s headquarters is a 50,000 square foot space that was designed and built specifically for our diamond tooling production. From the initial design we tried to take into account everything that would set us apart as a start of the art manufacturing facility. To maintain micron measurement consistency, and to allow for the cleanest and safest environment for our employees, the facility was designed with superior air quality in mind. Specially modified Trane (www.trane.com ) air handlers provide over 100 tons of conditioned air distributed throughout the shop by a DuctSox Textile Air Dispersion system (ductsox.com). Redundant Donaldson-Torit air scrubbers inside the facility further clean and recirculate inside air while dual 30 foot diameter overhead fans maintain constant air movement at 4 MPH. All interior and exterior doors are RFID and keypad controlled, and all CNC grinders and equipment are are monitored 24 hours a day 7 days a week by a 48 camera HD surveillance system. Production schedules, Key Performance Indicators, Safety Data and other relevant information are displayed and updated in real time on 40 inch LED TV monitors throughout the facility. BACK TO TOP BROAD CUSTOMER BASE The clients who use parts machined by STF come from a wide range of industries:   Speed Is One Of Our Unique Advantages STF is large enough to design and tool up an entire production line, yet small enough to do it quickly. Our exceptional staff and efficient internal structure allow us to consistently turn projects around ahead of our competition. Tool Fabrication Our in-house engineering and CAD systems can design your tool “from scratch”. Once you approve your tool print, the STF full service in-house machine shop can produce a final product in four weeks or less. Tool Refurbishing We have capabilities to regrind nearly every type of PCD, CBN or SCD tool. The tools can be shimmed*, reground** or retipped with a new piece of diamond to new tool dimensions. Unique Tooling Programs STF offers two uniques programs: 1. The Relap/replace Program 2. The One Price Program: pay one price wheather we must regrind, re-type or completely replace a tool. Rapid Turnaround STF employs two shifts daily to turn orders around faster than our competition. New tools are usually shipped within four weeks and regrinds within two weeks. Expedited delivery is available for a nominal fee, and if necessary, we can courier tools to your plant to keep your lines running. * The diamond is reheated, pushed out on the shank and grounded to a new tool dimension. ** The tool is ground sharp to a smaller precision. BACK TO TOP PRODUCTS POLYCRYSTALLINE DIAMOND TOOLS PCD tools are common in many industries, from automotive to woodworking and printing. These tools are typically lower cost than single-crystal diamond tools and are used in production machining of many parts. Different grades of PCD are used depending upon the requirements of surface finish, life, the material being cut, and the depth of the cut. Click on any tool for more information.

SINGLE CRYSTALLINE DIAMOND TOOLS Single-crystal diamond tools are used in a number of industries when surface finish is critical to the application. Because the cutting edge is made of one large diamond stone, the tool can be ground sharp to 10,000x magnification. Tolerances for SCD tools are typically much tighter and more controlled than for polycrystalline diamond tools. Our SCD tools are inspected by using a Nikon VMR 3020.
