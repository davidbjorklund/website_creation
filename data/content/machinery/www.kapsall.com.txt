I was first introduced to Kaps-All at a Packaging show where I visited their booth. What attracted me to their booth was the clean styling and overall appearance of their machines they had on display. Since that time I have purchased a total of 20 machines with 2 active open quotes for some additional equipment. I currently utilize their bottle unscramblers, bottle cleaners, bottle cappers, bottle over cappers, and label machines. Kaps-All's spare parts department is a breeze to work with and they have awesome turn around time on the parts I need. I have worked with them in obtaining change parts as new containers present themselves and have attended FAT's at their facilities. I will continue to do business with Kaps-All in the future. Their machine design, stainless steel offerings/options are a nice match for our food facility. Doug F. Boerne, TX Thanks for building user friendly, straightforward machines that are easy to operate and service. Doug F.

Read more Anthony Brzozowski We have been working to create a filling line at our new facility, and purchased the Au-3 Bottle Unscrambler. On top of having a helpful staff that addressed all of our concerns, the FAT was the most in depth and informative I have been involved with (thanks to Mike and Stan). The machine has held up to well over a million bottles in the past year, without as much as a jam or hitch - I think we had a power outage once that required the power to be reset- that was quite literally our only hangup. For the quality and price, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this company in the future. Ralph N. Dallas, TX Labeler arrived at 12 noon, installed by 1pm. Thanks guys! Ralph N.

Read more Fritz Waltjen We purchased an Unscrambler from Kaps-All recently. I am amazed! We set the machine up to the recipe provided by Kaps-All and it ran beautifully the first time. I did not need to play with the settings provided to get it to run, it simply ran when turned on after following Kaps-All's setup. The sale was flawless, all deadlines were met or exceeded. The machine was crated well and survived shipping from New York To Los Angeles with no issues at all. We run 5 - 8 hour shifts per week. The machine is running for 80% of that time. We have 5 containers 4 Oz to 1 Gallon and they all work great in the machine. We also have two jars that with some retooling also run on the machine without a hiccup. We also own a caper (A6) we purchased on the secondary market. The Kaps-All team did not let us down. After registering the machine Kaps-All helped us get the machine running our caps with minimal change parts. In fact we are currently working with Mike at Kaps-All to introduce another container and cap to this line. Any company that will support secondary owners and do it well is like gold. Kaps all is like platinum to me. I know my solved problems are a short phone call away.
