Typical drilling applications can be found in virtually all manufactured products where holes are required, such as; drilling holes in all types of wood furniture and wood products, drilling plumbing parts, drilling candle holes, drilling aluminum windows and doors, drilling small holes in all types of metal parts, as well as packaging, clean-room pharmaceutical and medical applications and many other applications utilizing drilling units and automated drilling systems. In addition, the versatility of Blackalloy™ drill units makes them an excellent choice for many applications other than drilling, such as bottle capping, robotics, winding, etc. Blackalloy's™ unique low-stress trilobe spindle is designed to transmit torque from the pulley to the spindle. Blackalloy™ drill units offer a full range of strokes, hydro-check (or feed control) equipment, spindle options including extended length with thru-holes, and many special modifications. Our modular approach to customizing automated drilling systems for small-hole drilling applications allows the potential user the option of selecting only those components which are required for specialized drilling applications. We offer engineering support, and 30-day trial & test drill units are available where there are serious multiple drill unit purchase possibilities. Our emphasis is on quality drilling products, competitive prices, off-the-shelf delivery, and courteous service. We will work with you to satisfy your drilling requirements in every possible way, and we welcome special drilling applications. Blackalloy™ Literature on all our drilling equipment is always available. If you have a current drilling application, require technical support for building a drilling system, or have any questions regarding Blackalloy™ drill units and accessories, Please contact our Customer Service Department. CUTTING TOOLS FOR THE TOUGHEST APPLICATIONS Blackalloy™ “525”™ is a high-cobalt tool composed primarily of Cobalt, Chromium and Tungsten, with minute quantities of other rare metals. Refined in an electric-arc furnace above 2500°F, and cast in chill molds, the alloy cannot be annealed and, therefore retains most of its original red-heat hardness. The manufacturing process produces a fine-grained hard surface of complex carbides with a tough inner core. PROUDLY MANUFACTURED IN THE USA FOR OVER 40 YEARS. #BeginLibraryItem "/Library/footer.lbi" Blackalloy Company of America • 1836 Lonestar Street • Unit 3 • Conway, SC 29526 Tel: (843) 347-3390 • Fax: (843) 347-3391 #EndLibraryItem Website Design and Development by Industrial Web Solutions End ImageReady Slices Web Traxs Code START Web Traxs Code END
