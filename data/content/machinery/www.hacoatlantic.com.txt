Software solutions A user-friendly, windows-based software package developed to control the integrated work-flow and interaction between your different Blanking presses Our standard range of mechanical blanking presses has been optimised and approved for more than 20 years. Press feeding The products we offer suit the needs of the most demanding users. Our lines are installed in the workshops of European automobile and steel industries. Tools & Dies Modern dies require heavy demands to the tool constructor and the die-spotting- and tryout presses. Drawing Hydraulic production presses for drawing operations have the advantage of full-rated capacity available over the entire stroke. Speed and capacity are also adjustable during the stroke. Forging BLISS-BRET built presses and systems for cold and hot forming, a technique in which we can look back on a long and successful tradition. Straightening Besides our roll straighteners (see decoiling lines) BLISS-BRET develops and builds hydraulic presses for straightening opertions. Cushion technology BLISS-BRET offers a large range of hydraulic and hydro-mechanical cushions. This high-tech equipment may be integrated in new BLISS-BRET presses as well as existing presses. Testing of piping Our test benches determines the fatigue endurance of tubes and pipes by applying cycles of stress induced by tension, compression and/or bending.
