The specialty chemical industry was thriving and Atlas became an integral supplier to most of the major players in the chemical process industry. Today, as the market place demands, we are focusing our unique capabilities and technical expertise to becoming the foremost supplier of sanitary heat exchangers used in the Pharmaceutical, Biotech, Food and Semi-Conductor Industries.
