From the smoothness of the cut surface after being worked to the amount of material that can be removed - this tool is my new go-to.`` Brian MacAllister BJMAC Canada — www.instagram.com/bjmacwoodwork/ ``My initial impression of the TURBO Plane, when compared side by side with several other styles of power carving wheels, is that the absence of fine dust makes using it in the shop an absolute pleasure. I was able to carve inside the shop, and while it did produce a substantial pile of shavings, the air stayed clear. The blade sculpted hardwood effortlessly, and left a smooth cut with almost no tear-out. I'm happy to have this tool in my arsenal and I would enthusiastically recommend it to my friends.`` Stones Throw Masonry & Landscaping Canada — www.stonesthrowmasonry.net I purchased the AS170 with one project in mind and it worked amazingly! It is a very versatile tool that is now my go to when toothing out bricks for masonry repairs inside and outside. With less dust and noise it sets us apart from our competition and our clients appreciate the professionalism Sigve Knutson - Experimental Designer Norway — www.sigveknutson.com/ Using the TURBO Plane, Industrial Woodcarver & Mini Grinder, the Mini Grinder is probably my favorite tool so far, so much fun and control! These tools fit my work very well as I am always searching for ways to shape materials in a intuitive way. The speed at which these tools allow me to shape wood is really great, and I feel like there is a lot of potential here that I still need to explore... Shane Christensen Australia — www.instagram.com/shane.artisan/ I carve a variety of sculptures from large to small, softwood to extremely hardwood. I use the Mini Grinder, Industrial Woodcarver and my new favorite, the TURBO Plane. I love the clean cuts and the user friendly design.
