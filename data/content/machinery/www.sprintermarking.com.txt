Topics include how to handle different surfaces, inks, equipment options, and much more. </div> Sprinter Marking prides itself for inventing and manufacturing the most simplistic designed innovative, versatile, low cost contact ink code marking machines on the market. In 1990, we designed and manufactured this innovative contact ink marker. We have been selling and servicing our equipment for over 25 years through agents and directly all over the world. Sprinter Marking manufactures a range of machine models that automatically ink code-mark messages or dots up to 2 square inches. These messages or dots can be produced on a wide range of surfaces including flat or circular, as well as porous or non-porous. These machines are very small in physical size, yet are built for rugged, reliable industrial operation and are capable of intermittent marking as well as high speed imprinting on a continuous basis. The markers can be mounted in any orientation on existing in-line production/ assembly lines or test stations to get a labor free ink mark. Sprinter’s industrial contact ink marking machines are also available for off-line operations as a complete system. In addition, Sprinter Marking offers two standard stand alone options: a benchmount and a benchtop system for low volume date/product marking production runs. We can also custom design a stand alone system for your product needs. Sprinter Marking has been involved with ink code-marking machines since the early 1970's and has a long list of Fortune 500 companies that are repeat buyers. If you are looking for a high quality, reliable, low maintenance, easy to operate contact code marking machine, contact Sprinter Marking to discuss your application .
