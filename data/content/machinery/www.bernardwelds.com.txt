That's why we allow you to configure a custom MIG gun for your specific application. Consider the impact of MIG guns on your business. As much as 85% of hand-held welding costs are labor related. What is the real cost of using outdated tools with poor ergonomics and excessive consumable and replacement part inventories?  The Bernard team can help all of your welders configure the MIG gun that is perfectly suited to their preferences and welding applications while keeping related parts and consumables to a minimum.  Happy and healthy welders are productive welders – a win-win for all involved!     Choose from our most popular products AccuLock S Consumables BTB MIG Guns Centerfire Consumables TOUGH LOCK Consumables QUICK LOAD Liner AutoLength System Bernard Clean Air Series Quik Tip Consumables Dura-Flux Gun with Replaceable...
