It is the sole distributor for Wiedenmann grounds maintenance machinery in the UK and Ireland. Initially known for introducing the Terra Spike range of deep aerators, its product range has expanded gradually with many quality innovative machines for natural and artificial turf. The starting premise of Wiedenmannâs German engineers is machines are technically efficient and built for purpose. Next, they are robust with minimal maintenance. Thirdly, not only must they meet health and safety requirements, they take them to the next level. The company supplies its products through a range of stocking dealers, supported regionally by Wiedenmann UKâs active sales team. Equally important is a high level of customer care and attention which reflects the quality of the fleet. Contact Wiedenmann UK We welcome enquiries.
