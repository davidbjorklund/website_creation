With over 1,000+ customers and counting , Tangi-Flow is the most complete and trusted provider in precision engineering. Auto-Retract Roller Boxes Tangi-Flow roller box turning is the most effective means of producing accurate, true and parallel diameters with maximum repeatability. Ideally suited to any manual, multi spindle or CNC lathe, the unique auto-retract action enables the roller box to be retracted in cycle whilst leaving no return mark on the work piece. Broaching Heads Rotary broaching is a fast and accurate method for producing internal and external forms in the end of the work piece. The broaching tool holder can be used on any CNC lathe, manual lathe, multi-spindle lathe, milling or drilling machine. CNC Tool Holders The latest edition to the Tangi-Flow product range – precision tool holders for CNC machines – enables us to offer a one-stop solution for your tool holding requirements. Driven by customer demand, our range of CNC tool holders are manufactured from case-hardened steel – core tensile strength min 800N/mm, surface hardness of HRC60 – and precision-ground for solid spindle contact. 0 Roller Boxes and Counting 0 Inserts Provided 0 Spares Parts Delivered “The service we receive is second to none.” “I am happy to endorse these products as a first class addition to our tooling consumables.” – MD-Hedfast Limited Benefits of Using Tangi-Flow over the Competition High precision tooling Top quality solutions Original manufacturer’s promise Get the aftercare you deserve Hundreds of spare parts available Tangi-Flow support team × How About This Wicked Cool Popup Modal?
