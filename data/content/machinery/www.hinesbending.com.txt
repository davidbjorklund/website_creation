Companies use Roll Benders for producing large radius bending. Materials are passed through three rollers, one top forming roller and two bottom rolls. The powered rotation for the forward and reverse movement creates the large sweeping radius bends. Roll Benders can be run vertically or horizontally to give the material more support.The digital readout allows for precise repeatable results. Roll benders can accommodate round, square, rectangle, oval, plates and profiled materials.

The control will detect and communicate any possible run time or interference problems before any material is wasted. A high performance Servo System is used to ensure accurate machine movements and excellent repeatability. The BendPro G2 CNC Control can interface to measuring machines to automatically close the loop on the inspection and correction process. An Industrial, Flat Panel PC serves as the operator interface and the control computer. This high level of integration reduces component count, cables, and connectors while increasing reliability. A touch screen with tempered glass eliminates the need for a keyboard and allows for reliable and easy operation. Only the highest quality components are used and are readily available from several sources world wide. No proprietary hardware is used.
