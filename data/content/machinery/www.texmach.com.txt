Your full-service equipment asset management resource. Tex-Mach, Inc. started in 1988 as a dealer of pre-owned textile equipment located in Mayo, SC (Spartanburg), specializing in the buying, selling, rigging, storing, and the redistribution of industrial equipment for the textile industry.  Since the very beginning our mission statement has been to build and maintain a reputation for honesty, integrity, and reliable service. As the company grew, Tex-Mach transitioned into other industrial equipment markets beyond the textile industry.  TMI’s strategy is to deliver the maximum return on the sale of non-producing assets by simultaneously representing our clients, while also creating a market for their assets.  We have the experience and contacts to match buyers and sellers on a global level.  We have 400,000 sq. feet of warehouse space and a sales team with over 200 years experience in the industrial plant and equipment industry.  Tex-Mach continually strives to exceed customer expectations.
