Our online auctions give you the opportunity to close some eventual automation gaps while limiting your investment costs. In many of our auctions you will find used robot technology at fair conditions - e.g. industrial robots, robotic welding cells and systems - which were already proven in ongoing production. A large selection of models from FANUC, KUKA and other top manufacturers are up for sale! All Industrial Robots Industrial Goods for all Sectors Although metal and woodworking are leading sectors of our industrial auction house, we are equally strong in other sectors. These include machines and vehicles for construction, plastics and electronics industries, window and door production and much more. In every online auction, you will also find cross-sector equipment that each workshop needs, such as: power tools, compressors, forklifts, cranes, storage technology, workshop cabinets, workbenches and many others at fair prices! Cross-sector Equipment New Standards for Factory Closures There are several service providers on the used machinery market, but when it comes to more complex tasks, such as punctual factory closures, we set the standard. Surplex experienced team of specialists is able to execute an online auction and hand over a clean swept warehouse, factory or workshop in a very short period of time. Subsequently, the factory halls are cleaned and reopened for new entrepreneurial ideas. We also release our clients from many unnecessary operational and bureaucratic tasks, e.g. customs clearance. With Surplex, your used machinery becomes your gain.  Machines that you have recently viewed About Us Services Job Openings Contact Help Masthead Terms and Conditions Data Privacy Info Sell Used Machninery Registration Our Apps Follow us facebook Youtube LinkedIn Do you have any questions?
