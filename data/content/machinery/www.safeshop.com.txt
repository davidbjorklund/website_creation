True to its name, the The BoaGrip™ nylon sling has a remarkably firm grasp. That’s because it was developed as the first adjustable rigging tool for hard-to-handle compressed gas cylinders. But the BoaGrip is not just a cylinder sling; it works equally well for rigging stainless steel pipe, rigging chrome shafts, rigging hydraulic cylinders, and rigging utility poles. The BoaGrip works better on more surfaces because it’s a rigging tool with a difference: Unlike other nylon slings, it has an inner surface that’s lined with polymer grippers, each one permanently bonded through a proprietary process. The fact is, until the BoaGrip nylon sling appeared, nylon slings in general had a rigging problem: They provided no way to get a good, quick grip on the shaft of cylindrical object. Rigging tapered utility poles was a particular problem, because traditional nylon slings would simply slide up the shaft. The BoaGrip nylon sling provides a rigging solution thanks to its proprietary polymer grips. Their unique “squeezing” action saves time in most rigging situations. For instance, if a crew is rigging a light pole, they can now simply pick a spot anywhere above the “tipping point,” fasten the sling, and lift. Crews no longer have to use improvised rigging tactics like clamping a truck boom to the shaft of the pole. This innovative below-the-hook rigging sling comes in a standard 70-inch version and also a 52-inch model that’s handy for jobs in tight spaces, for instance, rigging and lifting a hydraulic cylinder onto a truck bed. Compared to the average nylon sling, the BoaGrip nylon sling has an aggressive, active grip. In rigging situations, it acts like a high-tech lasso: When it’s pulled taut, its polymer grips are forced onto the surface of the object. The grip of this remarkable nylon sling is further enhanced by a unique stainless steel link which ensures that the gripping surface is held flat all the way around the object, without twisting. In short, when it comes to nylon slings for rigging jobs, nothing outgrips the BoaGrip.    Turning Ideas Into Successful Products      Home  |   Press Releases   |     Contact Us Copyright © 1992-2011 Safe Shop Tools, LLC.
