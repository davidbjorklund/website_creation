DOOSAN CORPORATION MOTTROL DPA pump 2012-09-10 DOOSAN MOTTROL DPA Pump Series PR Material Scenario (Ver.02.10) (RT. 4 minutes 30 seconds ~ 5 minutes (including interview)) Welcome to the world of the DPA Pump Series, a hydraulic masterpiece from DOOSAN MOTTROL which is the result of 30 years’ know-how, the world’s best engineers’ designs, world class production facilities, and a record of perfect performance, passing the most rigorous tests. The DPA Pump Series has given birth to the remarkable technology of DOOSAN MOTTROL, which is leaping ahead to become a No.1 Global Hydraulic Device Maker. Doosan Mottrol is already Korea’s best hydraulic device specialist. There are many reasons why experts in the world praise the DPA Pump. To respond to new environmental regulation, the serial type pumps, which produce superior performance in efficiency and noiselessness, have been reduced in length. Compared to other series type pumps, the DPA series’ reduced length of 20% and reduced weight of 18% makes for easier installation and convenient handling. Piston type hydraulic pumps have high-level pulsations and noises because of their structural limitations. The DPA Pump Series reduces pulsation by 50% with its innovative PCV structure and implemented optimal housing. (Interview) The Radial Force of the swash plate type piston pump makes the rotating group in the pump unstable and reduces efficiency. The DPA Pump Series is designed to minimize the influence of Radial Force on the Rotating Group. Such innovations create reduced fuel consumption. This pump series has even received praise from Bosch Rextroth company for its world class efficiency. (interview) The DPA pump has increased durability because of improvements in the materials, heat treatment, and in the design of swash plate, along with changes to the regulator, actuator piston, and the Rotating Group which are the main abrasion components of the swash plate type piston pump. It received perfect evaluation results from Bosch Rexroth’s rigorous durability tests. As well, it received the same results from the bench durability test done by DOOSAN MOTTROL. The DPA pump series regulators are designed to accommodate various flow control methods according to market demand. It passed the severe environmental tests, as well as basic function tests. It also received enormous welcome and praise from customers, after four years of testing in the field. The DPA Pump Series is produced with world class quality, based on state-of-the-art manufacturing technology and capacity. Now, you will experience it.
