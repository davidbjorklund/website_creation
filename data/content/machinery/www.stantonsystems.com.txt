Wheel Washing in America There has been an increased need in America at many industrial sites, as well as construction sites, to have a reliable wheel wash system . It is becoming imperative in many communities to have wheel washes at construction projects that track mud out on to the streets. The mud can get on the wheels and tires from rain events as well as wetting dust with water trucks to prevent fugitive dust emissions. By installing a wheel wash , many of these mud track-out problems are eliminated. By installing a wheel wash a great deal of expense can be saved. There have been several studies by construction firms that have found manually washing at a job site using the rock-bed exit method and water truck/broom washing the streets is eight times more expensive than installing a wheel wash, not to mention the fact that regulators and county officials tend to work better with contractors that appear to be responsible and sensible. Many contractors in the past have gone to the rock-bed exit method to remove mud from tire profiles. This has been the go-to effort for many years since many contractors have not realized there is a wheel wash manufacturer in America solving these problems day in and day out for the past 30 years. That brings us around to Stanton Systems, the originator and pioneers in the wheel washing industry in America. Stanton Systems' philosophy of removing mud from truck tires is that it has to be done thoroughly within the confines of the wash station. Once the truck is gone, it's gone for good and mud left on the tires will create a nuisance of cost and a liability to the general contractor as well as the owner of the construction site. We are seeing more and more engineers specifying wheel washes for construction sites as well as industrial sites. We invite these engineers to become familiar with Stanton Systems products, innovations and services. We can be viewed and reached at Tirewash.com or Wheelwash.net . There is a sample specification that engineers can use to spec out a wheel wash for their projects. This spec can be found on the portables page of our website. This portable page also covers permanent wash systems as well. Our popular STB 30 wheel wash can be a portable or a permanent system.
