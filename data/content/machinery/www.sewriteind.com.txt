The success of Sew-Rite International is based on building a long term relationship with our customers, some of whom have been doing business with us since the 1970's, it is our interest in these relationships rather than simply a one-time sale of machinery that has allowed us to reach the position of being leaders in the bag closing industry of Southern Africa. We have a truly dedicated team of staff members with a combined knowledge in our industry of over 150 years. We can supply standard equipment or design an innovative system to suite your needs and budget. From sewing and sealing bags of paper, jute, woven polypropylene to plastic bags, we can help. Sew-Rite international's head office is based in Pietermaritzburg with branches in the Free State and Johannesburg regions that include sewing and workshop departments. Whether it's a replacement part of your sewing machine, bag closer, thread, a new bag stitcher or a fully automated bagging line, Sew-Rite Internationalâs equipment and knowledge can help you improve efficiency and reduce costs.
