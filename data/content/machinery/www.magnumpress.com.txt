MAGNUM HYDRAULIC AND ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS Magnum hydraulic and electrical systems are designed for hydraulic presses. Our philosophy is to build simple, reliable and easily serviceable systems utilizing standard off-the-shelf hydraulic and electrical components that can be purchased from Magnum or from your local fluid power or electrical component supplier. At the forefront of our electrical systems is safety. The heart of our hydraulic systems are steel manifolds designed to consolidate valving, reduce plumbing, eliminate leaks and provide maximum service life. All pressure connection points have O-ring seals – no metal to metal pressure connections and no pipe threads. Magnum Press hydraulics have dual redundant safety features built into every standard press manifold that we build. Magnum hydraulic press systems incorporate fast acting electro-hydraulic decompression on the blind side of the cylinder to eliminate shock pressure waves and insure maximum service life for the system components. The entire system is designed to minimize response time to give you more parts per shift.
