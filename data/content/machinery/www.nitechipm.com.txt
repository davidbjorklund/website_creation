When we developed our line of stretch wrappers we decided to focus on building a durable and dependable line of machines that would have all  the features you need to wrap a product without the high price ticket. Our stretch wrappers are built using structural steel throughout the machine to hold up when wrapping loads that weigh up to 6,000lbs. All operating controls, start, stop and dispenser controls use conventional toggle switches, dials and buttons for durability and long life.
