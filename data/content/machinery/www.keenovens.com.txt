About Keen Welding Consumable Storage Ovens: Since 1923 , welding professionals around the world have trusted Keen welding ovens for dependable, welding consumable storage. Our stick electrode ovens, submerged arc flux ovens and custom consumable storage ovens can fulfill just about any requirement. Welding technology changes rapidly and Keen welding is there for you. Our mixed-use MIG wire and TIG wire storage oven (K-1000M&T) was the first in the industry. Other firsts were the segregated TIG filler rod storage oven (KT-99) and inert atmosphere welding consumable storage ovens (nitrogen purge capable).Â  Our engineering staff at Keen Ovens strives to keep the convenience and practical needs of today's welders foremost in their productions. Types of Ovens: Welding Electrode Rebake Ovens - Coatings on welding electrodes quickly absorb atmospheric moisture when taken out of the can. This moisture contains hydrogen which will eventually enter the weld and cause cracking. Damaged electrodes need to be rebaked at high temperatures to restore them . The Keen KHT-500 500 lb. capacity oven and the KHT-900 1000 lb. capacity oven are perfect solutions. Our proprietary shelving configuration will ensure effective heating and restoration of your electrodes. Welding Flux Storage and Rebake Ovens - We offer 125 lb, 300 lb and 600 lb hopper-style flux holding ovens with maximum temperature of 550Â°F for maintaining factory fresh dryness. We also offer the 600 lb. high temperature KHTF-600 flux rebake oven which reaches 1000Â°F. Our flux ovens have the quickest heat-up times in the industry due to our unique element configuration and rugged oven design. Portable Welding Electrode Ovens - We offer a broad range of capacities in our portable range. We manufacture 5 lb., 15 lb. and 50 lb. portable models. Rugged and durable, these ovens will keep your rods factory dry in the field. Available with or without thermostat. Take what you need from the shop holding oven, and load up a Keen portable before heading to the field. MIG Wire and TIG Filler Rod Holding Ovens - We offer the broadest range of MIG & TIG storage ovens in the welding industry. For small shops we have compact bench-top models like the K-4RS which holds 4-33# wire spools, and the K-4RSM which holds up to 4-60# wire spools. For the large shop we offer a broad range of options for Mig, Tig and mixed storage ovens like the industry first K-MPO mixed use oven and the KT-99 originally designed for Boeing. With Keen, your expensive MIG and TIG consumables will always be protected. Floor Welding Electrode Ovens and Bench Welding Electrode Ovens - Our 450 lb. capacity K-450 model is known around the world for its rugged construction and ease of use. There are units still in use since the early 1970's. The K-200 is very popular with the smaller shop for its compact size and efficient heating.
