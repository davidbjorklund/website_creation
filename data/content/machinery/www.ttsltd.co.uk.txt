TTS new Loading About Us Services Contact end nav end header TEXTILE & TECHNICAL SERVICES LTD Suppliers of machinery & raw materials to industry in Africa Textile & Technical Services Ltd was founded in 1982 to support companies looking to expand their business in West Africa. What made TTS unusual was the unique make-up of personnel with decades of experience of working in Africa. In unsettled times it was clear that companies wishing to expand in the African continent needed to feel secure, and TTS offered just such security with their depth of knowledge and expertise of African markets. It was also important to provide a high level of after sales service and maintain continuous support for the supplier and the customer. end first column Upholding these core values to this day TTS operates predominantly in Nigeria, having an office in Lagos, and in Ghana and Senegal. The entire East African region is worked through associates in Kenya and Sudan. TTS continues to this day in the tradition it began not only supplying capital machinery, raw materials and accessories, but also offering invaluable support to ensure payment is secure. end second column end section TEXTILE & TECHNICAL SERVICES LTD Our range col start Flexible Packaging Machinery CI Flexographic Printing Presses Slitters/Rewinders Laminators end column Packaging Systems FFS & Twist Wrap Machinery - New & Reconditioned Cut & Wrap Machinery Lollipop Machinery Confectionery Machinery - New & Reconditioned Canning Lines end column Printing Industry Supplies BOPP, CPP, Cello, PET, PVC Film Aluminium Foil Gravure Printing Inks & Coatings Flexo Printing Inks & Coatings Lamination Adhesives end column Adhesives Lamination Bottle Labelling Book Binding Envelopes Paper Converting Wood Furniture Corrugated end column Food Ingredients Malt extract Glucose Maltodextrin Food colouring Specialist flavours Emulsifiers Stabilisers end column Spare Parts & Consumables Needles Sinkers Dr Blades Gravure Cylinders Cleaning Products for Printers Knives & Sealing Jaws Cotton Webbing Biscuit Cutters & Rollers end column Miscellaneous Filter Paper Promotional Materials end column end section end section Contact UK TTS Lower Park Barn Chilton Business Centre Chilton, Aylesbury Bucks  HP18 9LS t:  +44 1844 204910 e:   info@ttsltd.co.uk end contact-box LAGOS Grosworld Intl Ltd 15/17 Abimbola St Isolo, Lagos Mr Ted Coventry t:  +234 803 3033535 e:   ted@ttsltd.co.uk end contact-box Mr Emeka Onyekuru t:  +234 803 7270074 e:   emeka@ttsltd.co.uk end contact-box NAIROBI ACE Unit 35, Alpha Centre Mombasa Rd, Nairobi Mr Alton Rego t:  +254 722 898 244 e:   altonrego@me.com end contact-box       end contact-box KHARTOUM Mr Taha El-Roubi Khartoum, Sudan t:  +249 911 283 002 e:   telroubi@gmail.com end contact-box       end contact-box © 2015 TTS Ltd end footer JS FILES
