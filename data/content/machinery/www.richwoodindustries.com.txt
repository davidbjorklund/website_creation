Richwood has always stated that by using our Controlled Velocity Finishing Machine and our customized deburring processes, the overall compressive residual stress of the part will be significantly improved. To back up our claim, Richwood sent sample parts to an outside Laboratory, Lambda, for testing. The testing method used was x-ray diffraction. Richwood is excited to share the results of the Lambda report, which prove our claims. Results show that using our methods, the compressive residual stress of the part is significantly improved in comparison to other traditional methods of surface finishing.
