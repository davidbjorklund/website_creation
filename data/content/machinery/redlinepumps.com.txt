Their heavy duty reduced speed motors are ideal for most any oil transfer or filtration application. They run at a reduced speed which makes them capable of moving most petroleum based liquids even when they are cold (below 40 degrees F).  Their helical gear design makes them powerful, efficient, and quiet. The MP3500RSG features a 1/2 HP industrial grade electric motor pre-wired for 110 volt operation. It can be wired 220 volt if needed.  The MP3500RSG 1/2 HP Redline transfer pump can be used for waste motor oil, bulk motor oil, hydraulic oil, gear lube, waste vegetable oil, diesel fuel, fuel oil, mineral oil, silicone oil, transformer oil, and antifreeze.  It's flow rate is between 10-12 gallons per minute depending on the viscosity and the temperature of your oil. It draws just 9.2 amps so it can run on wall outlet power and has a 12 gauge power cord with an on-off toggle switch. It weighs 49 pounds and has a carry handle which makes it very portable for remote oil transfer compared to larger oil transfer systems.  The MP3500RSG 1/2 HP Redline transfer pump features a heavy duty rotary gear head that is self primeing with a built in pressure relief system.  It can be used as a dispensing or a filtration pump. It will automatically regulate the amount of pressure it produces in the outlet line. That protects the system from overload when the flow is slowed down or stopped by a filter or a shut off nozzle. It can operate like a pump at the gas station which makes it a very versatile tool when filling drums, engines, or power equipment reservoirs. It also makes a great filtration pump that will provide steady pressure and when the filter is plugged, the pump will go into bypass mode. The MP3500RSG Redline transfer pump will deliver up to 100 PSI. It can lift oil 15 feet vertically and can push oil through 100 feet of outlet hose if needed. It needs to be used with 1" ID or larger hose.  The 1/2 HP MP3500RSG is a reduced speed transfer pump designed for pumping thick, heavy, or cold oil. It operates at 1140 RPM.  Most pumps run at 1800-3600 rpm making them not suitable for heavy or cold oil transfer. They will burn up due to overload with heavy or cold oil transfer. A waste of time and money!  Accessories for the MP3500RSG 1/2 HP Redline transfer pump are a complete hose kit for $285.00, a cleanable strainer system for $185.00, or a suction wand with screen for $45.00.  A must to protect the pump from debris. Oil resistant hose is $6.00 per foot and is available in any length.   Suction hose is $4.00 per foot. The MP3500RSG 1/2 HP Redline Transfer Pump is $799.00 + $80.00 shipping.

Miller Redline MP3500F 1/2 HP Redline Transfer/Filtration System Features the MP3500RSG Transfer Pump with a 10 Micron Spin On Filter System. $899.00 + 100.00 Shipping. Call 1-605-881-3473 to Order.                              The   Redline  MP3500F features a Powerful 1/2 HP Reduced Speed Transfer Pump along with a 10 micron spin-on filter system. It has a  1/2 HP 110 Volt Industrial electric motor with electronic speed reduction  and thermal protection. It's heavy duty 3/4" port cast iron pump with steel gears and adjustable pressure relief system puts out 100 PSI. You can increase or decrease the pressure by turning an adjustment bolt. This filtration system features a 10 micron spin-on filter standard. It can also accept a water block filter if you need to remove water from your oil. These water block filters are available upon request. The cast aluminum filter head can accept a pressure gauge. The gauge for this system is an extra $20.00. The pressure gauge will help indicate when your filter is plugged with debris. There in no pressure relief system in the filter head itself so no unfiltered oil can get past the filter element. When the filter plugs, the pump will automatically go into bypass mode. It will create pressure against the filter until it is changed. With this system, you have the option of filtering or just transferring your oil. This is done by the use of 2 brass ball valves. One shuts the filter off and on and the other allows the flow of oil out of the pump to be sent to a bypass hose. The 10 micron filter elements for this system can be purchased at most auto parts stores! We sell them as well for $17.00 each. The 10 micron water block filters are $19.00 each. 3 Micron filters are $19.00 each. To add a cleanable 10 micron filter system to this pump, add $250.00. The cleanable filter eliminates the need to buy replaceable elements and offers more effective filtration than the spin-on replaceable element.   It draws 9.2 amps. This system is set up for use with 1" ID hose. We have 1" ID oil resistant hose for $6.00 per foot.  Suction hose is $4.00. We have a 42" long suction wand with a 16 mesh screen for $45.00. We also have aluminum trigger nozzles for $50.00.  The standard MP3500F as shown above is $899.00 + $100.00 shipping. Call 1-605-881-3473 to order with your credit card. Redline MP3500F Complete Waste Oil Transfer/Filtration System Features a 1/2 HP Motor, 3/4" Port Gear Head, a 10 Micron Spin-On Filter System, 20 Feet of 1" Oil Resistant Hose, and a Suction Wand with a 16 Mesh Screen. $1049.00 + $115.00 Shipping. Call 1-605-881-3473 to Order. The Redline   MP3500F   Complete Waste Oil Filtration System incorporates a modular design featuring a powerful 1/2 HP transfer pump along with two main filtration components. This system also offers 10  feet of high quality 1" oil resistant pressure hose and 10 feet of durable suction hose. The first filtration component is the 42" long suction wand with a 16 mesh screen that is placed into the oil source. The oil then goes through the 3/4" port pumping unit and out to the 10 micron spin on filter. This system has a dual ball valve system that allows the user to either filter or bypass the oil in the final stage. We do offer a dual filter system that puts two filters in series. This is a good idea if your filtering oil that is to be burned in a vehicle as fuel or in waste oil burners. Two filters, like the 10 micron and the 3 micron would be best in a dual filter set-up. The extra filter system would add $60.00 (plus additional shipping and handling).  We also have gauges for this system for $20.00 each. If you filter waste vegetable oil, the oil should be 140 degres in temperature. If your collecting WVO, the oil can bypass the final filter. If your collecting waste motor oil that is below 30 degrees in temperature, you would want to bypass the oil past the final filter. The system can be used with a 10 micron, 10 micron water block, or a 3 micron element. The 10 Micron filters can be purchased at most auto parts stores! They cost $17.00 each. The 10 micron water block filters are $19.00 each and we stock them. The 3 micron filters are $19.00 each. To add a cleanable 10 micron filter, add $250.00 (plus additional shipping and handling costs). The cleanable filter eliminates the need to buy replaceable elements and offers more effective filtration than replaceable filter elements.  If filtering down to 10 microns, your waste vegetable oil should  be at least 140 degrees in temperature or the filter can plug after just a few gallons. The exception to this is if the oil is of real good quality. The quality of the oil determines if it will filter at temps below 140 degrees. Motor oil can be filtered without heating as long as the oil is warmer 30 degrees F. Colder motor oil will filter more slowly. This system is $1049.00 + $115.00 shipping.
