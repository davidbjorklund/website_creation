People are often confused about the difference between weight (mass) and force. Scales measure weight (mass) in pounds (lb) or kilograms (kg), etc. Force gauges, on the other hand, measure force in Newtons. (In the US, other units such as lbf, ozf and kgf are also in use.) One Newton is defined as the force needed to accelerate 1 kilogram of mass at the rate of 1 meter per second every second. You can feel this one Newton force by putting a small apple (100 g) on your palm. Read More...
