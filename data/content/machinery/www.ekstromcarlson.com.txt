Mistic mist cooling spray system Mistic Mist Systems are considered the most efficient mist systems for a cooling spray. The compressed air passing through the valve body and to the nozzle tip creates a vacuum in the liquid line which draws coolant from the tank.  The coolant is instantly vaporized and forms a conical mist pattern. At the same time, the compressed air expands absorbing heat surrounding the tool and work piece. The result is a cooling effect as well as lubrication.
