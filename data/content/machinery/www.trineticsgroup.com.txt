We utilize in house engineering, plastic assembly production personnel, customized dedicated production machines, plastic and metal machining, and plastic welding equipment to achieve the final plastic part. Ultrasonic Welding Powered by Sound ult_pricing_heading ult_price_body_block Learn More ult_price_link This technique uses high-frequency ultrasonic acoustic vibrations are locally applied to workpieces being held together under pressure to create a solid-state weld. ult_price_features pricing_table pricing_table_wrap Infrared Welding Powered by Heat ult_pricing_heading ult_price_body_block Learn More ult_price_link Infrared welding is a non-contact thermal welding   technique capable of producing very strong, air-tight welds in thermoplastic parts. Great for encasing electronics. ult_price_features pricing_table pricing_table_wrap Spin Welding Powered by Friction ult_pricing_heading ult_price_body_block This technique uses rotational force and downward pressure to create torque friction between two parts. Proper joint design and material compatibility are key to a good spin weld. ult_price_features pricing_table pricing_table_wrap Extrusion Welding Powered by Gas ult_pricing_heading ult_price_body_block Learn More ult_price_link Extrusion welding allows for welding of large plastic parts and tanks using hand welding equipment. This is an additive process that creates extremely strong welds between perpendicular surfaces. ult_price_features pricing_table pricing_table_wrap Engineering Design Services We can create or modify engineering drawings for your part or product.
