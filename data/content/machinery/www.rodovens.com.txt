Leading industry experts unanimously agree that proper welding consumable storage is a critical step in the welding process and essential for creating defect-free welds. For example, low hydrogen welding electrodes must be conditioned properly before starting a welding job to prevent problems such as porosity, hydrogen embrittlement and cracking. While welding, it is crucial to maintain low-hydrogen rods or electrodes in a holding oven within a temperature range of 100°F and 300°F. This prevents water vapor from permeating the welding rod and entering the weld which can lead to defects. Let's face it, an old beat up refrigerator and a light bulb will not cut it... The possible repercussions of improperly executing a weld can easily cost thousands of dollars in repairs and rework time. Utilizing an improperly maintained welding rod which has not been kept at the proper temperature - especially in a building erection environment - can have disastrous consequences.   Read more img src="https://www.rodovens.com/media/wysiwyg/video.jpg" alt="" /   BENEFITS OF PURCHASING from RodOvens.com Lowest prices on rod ovens 105% price guarantee 30-day money-back guarantee Free shipping to your business Experts on international fulfillment Custom Oven Sales Convenience of shopping online Pay no taxes (excluding FL) You can save hundreds of dollars.
