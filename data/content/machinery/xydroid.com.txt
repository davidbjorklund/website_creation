It is used extensively in making molding for architectural uses. This is the basic function of the Xydroids, although they perform other tasks too, such as, column-turning, 3-d shaping, etc., using various optional attachments. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Hot Wire Slabbers A Slabber is used to produce large volumes of EPS foam slabs. These machines use a grid of hot wires that are manually set. These machines are generally stationary foam tables (the foam does not move). The set of hot wires moves across the machine and through the foam blocks. This system creates consistently accurate cuts throughout the entire length of the blocks. The harp has a pivoting design which allows cutting in both directions! .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_column Downcutters A Downcutter is a stationary foam cutting table that uses an automated vertical moving hot wire grid. This machine has a heavy-duty design and uses a positive drive at all four corners for precision accuracy. This machine comes standard with 10 Long & 20 Short wires. Other options for different block sizes and number of hot wires are available. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Slabber/Downcutter Combo Machines The Slabber / Downcutter Combo machine combines both the Slabber machine and the Downcutter machine together. This machine can perform either or both operations without having to move the foam block more than once. The combination of these two machines is also a great space saver. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section EPS Cutting Machines Foam Contour Machines EPS Foam Slabbers EPS Foam Downcutters Slabber/Downcutter Combo Foam Router Machines EPS Plunge Cutters Foam Shaping Tables Automatic Hot Wire Setters Arch & Base Machine .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Resources About Xycorp Testimonials FAQ Blog Privacy Policy Sitemap Contact .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Contact Xycorp, Inc. 1258 Montalvo Way Palm Springs, CA 92262 P: 760-323-0333 P: 888-745-0333 E: sales@xycorpinc.com .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section .entry-content .et_pb_post #main-content Facebook Twitter Google Copyright© 2017 Xycorp, Inc. .container #main-footer #et-main-area #page-container Start of Tawk.to Script End of Tawk.to Script
