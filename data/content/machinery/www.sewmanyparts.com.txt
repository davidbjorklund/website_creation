937-258-4481 or sales@sewmanyparts.com * We have multiple shipping locations, but our primary one is located in Dayton, Oh. Due to the number of products and blend of products offered, we do our best to ship everything together, within 2-3 business days of when we receive your order, from the closest location. MOST orders are fulfilled the same day or the following business day. We confirm via email the ship date. We will contact you on any orders with express shipping as soon as possible to discuss options if we cannot ship the same business day (unless placed after hours, then it will be the following business day). We cannot guarantee shipping times during holidays due to UPS and USPS schedules. *Most products are in stock. Orders mixing uncommon Madeira thread AND parts or other supplies are the orders most likely to not ship the same day. *If a price cannot be honored, or a part is found to be discontinued, we will refund your order within 1 business days. Due to the large amount of product we support and the changing nature of availability as well as technical updating and work involved in supporting our website there is a rare occasion where we cannot honor the price shown. In this very rare instance, we will address it with all haste. *For most orders under $25.00, you can select our US Media Mail flat shipping rate of $7.50. Exclusions include some products that are chemicals / lubricants and/or very large but inexpensive items, such as 3D foam. This shipping method does not include a tracking number and we cannot guarantee a delivery date. *We did not program all the weights into our website, so most of the time ordering through the web gets you better shipping rates. Shhhh……. That is a secret. Call for a return authorization #. Returns are handled on a case by case basis. Unused, non-special order items that do not require cutting, modification or manufacture are returnable within 30 days. Freight costs will not be credited on returns, unless it was an error on our part. We may authorize other returns for used, special order, cut, modified or manufactured goods with a restock fee, or any goods outside of 30 days. Please contact us to discuss these cases. We will in good faith do our best to help our customers in every case.
