Vibration and Balancing Systems Engine Signal Conditioning Charge Amplifiers Diagnostics Encased in a rugged shell, MTI Instruments’ portable signal generator is ideal for system troubleshooting, testing, and calibrating electronic equipment and machinery monitoring systems. It simulates eddy current, accelerometer, strain gauge and other types of pulse, sinusoidal, triangle, or digital pulse trains. Portable Signal Generator Semiconductor / Solar Metrology Systems MTI Instruments offers manual and semi-automated metrology systems for the solar and semiconductor industries. These capacitance based systems, built around the company’s proprietary push/pull technology, provide non-contact measurement of thickness, TTV, and bow/warp. Applications include the fabrication of solar/photovoltaic, semiconducting, and semi-insulating wafers. Manual Semiconductor Metrology System Semi-automated Metrology System Photovoltaic/Solar Metrology System OEM / Custom Solutions For OEMs with more tailored precision displacement needs, MTI Instruments offers rapid-deployment custom measurement solutions. The building block of our custom systems is the Accumeasure platform of amplifiers which can be custom-made to match specific performance needs. This platform provides exceptional value and offers sub-nanometer resolution, extremely high stability, and fast response time, making it ideal for many different applications including micro-positioning, thermal correction, focusing and closed-loop applications.
