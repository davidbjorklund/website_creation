This year we celebrate 20 years of activity ? we started in 1995 ? and for the occasion last September we transferred to a much more spacious and comfortable site in via Seconda Strada, in the heart of the industrial area of Arzignano. The entire structure has an area of about 700 square metres, 500 of them are dedicated to the production sector and other 200 to offices, with environments designed to give prestige to the company image and receive Italian and foreign customers in the best way. <div class="zoomlente" style="position:absolute; margin-left:0px;#margin-left:-274px;margin-top:80px;#margin-top:-25px"><a href="#" class="zoomModal" rel="70"><img src="images/zoomlens.png" border="0"/></a></div> Youtube Channel CERMAC s.r.l.

Might say that's the only thing that counts. But I'm not really satisfied with just that. Being a sales manager, I often face a simple yet important question: am I really selling what I say I sell? If you, dear reader, have the same task I have in your company, you will often have said "the best product at the best price". But do you truly believe what you are saying? This was for me the first thing I wanted to make sure of when I started this project with CERMAC. It was to my pleasure to see that it is indeed how I say it is. If you want to know why you should choose our products? well let me show you some really good reasons. 1) We MAKE our spare parts. We are not just resellers. We have total control over the production of EVERY spare part we make, from the raw material to the boxing of the part ready to be shipped. 2) We FOLLOW our clients, from the early stage of "what does he need to get the best out of his splitting machine?" We are always available to give you our fullest technical support, based on years of experience in the sector. 3) We LOVE our job and we take it SERIOUSLY. This work is our passion, and we dedicate all of our time and resources to give everyday a service better than the day before. 4) What we SAY is what we DO. When we send you our offer, we already point out costs and time of delivery. We always do our best to have everything ready BEFORE the estimated time. When you contact us, you are not just buying a product. You are getting an entire SERVICE dedicated to you and your machine. Words can do so much, so I invite you to contact us in order to better understand what we do and to be able to fully experience the quality of our service. <div class="zoomlente" style="position:absolute; margin-left:0px;#margin-left:-274px;margin-top:80px;#margin-top:-25px"><a href="#" class="zoomModal" rel="59"><img src="images/zoomlens.png" border="0"/></a></div> Simac Tanning-Tech 2016 We take this opportunity to inform you that this year we will be present as visitors to the Tanning-Tech in Milan.
