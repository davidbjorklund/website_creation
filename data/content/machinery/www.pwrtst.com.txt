Power Test Updates What Is A Dyno? Careers Events History We Make Your Testing Easy Engine Dynamometers An engine dynamometer is a device used to test an engine that has been removed from a vehicle, ship, generator, or various other pieces of equipment. The intent is to confirm performance before the engine is installed. Power Test dynamometers can help facilities troubleshoot by determining an engine’s functionality while under load. Additionally, they can verify the quality of a build, rebuild, or repair in a controlled environment before the engine is put into use. Having an engine dyno in your facility will give you confidence and peace of mind that your equipment is fully functional, and that it was fixed right the first time. Power Test’s wide range of engine dynamometers feature water brake, eddy current, and alternating current braking technologies, and are capable of testing engines ranging from 50 to 10,000 horsepower.  Our versatile line up of products come available in portable and permanent solutions, with a full catalog of testing designed to Make Your Testing Easy.
