Although I’ve not put my machine fully through it’s paces it’s running much better already. The whole process of dropping off the machine and collection was very easy. I really appreciated the email updates as I was overseas while it was being serviced.

Dave Hutchens This file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.    Brilliant and personal service. Nothing was too much trouble and Duncan was very helpful, even carying my machine out to my car!. You are now my chosen service provider for my Bernina! Thank you. Debbie Bradley This file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.    The Sewing and Knitting Centre did a long overdue service on my rather ancient sewing machine and did a marvelous job. I used my machine for the first time today and it really purred along where before it was definitely clattering along! They kept me well informed with the progress of the service and it was ready before the promised time. An advantage is the easy parking outside or in adjacent streets. Would recommend them. Barbara Lees This file should primarily consist of HTML with a little bit of PHP.    Was able to park right outside the shop. Was very satisfied with the service and repair of my Bernina sewing machine. Helpful, polite and friendly communication with Duncan. Would recommend this service to others. Thank you Duncan.
