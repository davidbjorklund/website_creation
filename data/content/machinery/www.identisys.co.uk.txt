ON SITE SUPPORT CONTRACT BUREAU MARKING SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT Testimonials Peter, Luke and Franco provided an excellent response to an issue we had with a normally reliable metal embossing machine. The service visit was conducted in a timely and professional manner. When the fault represented itself Peter didn't hesitate in sending his team out immediately to help resolve the problem. Many thanks for the support and advice guys! Paul Hudson, Workshop Operations Manager Jaguar Land Rover We’ve been very pleased with how the machine runs for us since it was installed many years ago. The service we have received from the Identisys team has been great, including callouts and servicing. We have always had a reasonable callout time, even to where we are in Leeds. Shaun Carter, Operations Manager Supercrease Limited “The machine does exactly what is asked of it and rarely breaks down or requires a call out. It is used extensively within the Assembly department daily by experienced operators of this type of machine, they are very happy with it. In addition they have been very happy with the service provided by Identisys.” Terry Owen Bailey & Mackey Ltd Latest News May 22, 2019 Published by Peter Rust at May 22, 2019 Categories News Our new Marketing Manager Identisys Ltd are delighted to announce the appointment of their new Marketing Manager, Sarah Church.
