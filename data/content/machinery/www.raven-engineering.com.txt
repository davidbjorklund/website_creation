LAYER NR. 5 Contact Us Today END REVOLUTION SLIDER Best Balancing Solutions. Period. All of our balancing machines come equipped with a drive unit and HBI-25 balance indication system. The drive unit utilizes a hard-bearing suspension. The rotation of the part around its geometric axis causes centrifugal forces on the bearing pedestals of the machine. Piezo-electric measuring elements in the pedestals convert these forces into analogue alternating voltages. These voltages are electronically amplified and sensed by the HBI-25 to indicate the weight and angular position of the unbalance in the part.
