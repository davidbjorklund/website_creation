As of late, most brewers find it useful to use both 12 oz. and 16 oz. cans with pressure sensitive labels. Labels can be easily made for small product runs as new and seasonal brews are created. The Model 620S Automatic Round Product Labeling System is ideal for the brew cans. The system offers output speeds to suit the small brewers as well as speeds that can handle much larger product labeling runs.
