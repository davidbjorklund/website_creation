MAUS as an organization has recently decided to reassess the new market demands and to challenge itself by adapting the product to the realities of todayâs global marketplace. Download the Brochure FLEXIBILITY AND QUALITY The end goal was to develop a new automatic grinding machine that would provide more flexibility, with user friendly programming capabilities, an ease of operation and maintenance, lower delivery costs, reduced operating costs, a more attractive price and a very reasonable ROI, improving productivity, quality and profitability. EASY TO PROGRAM The new ReadyGrindâ¢ is a grinding machine that is programmable either inside the machine with a joystick or off-line using a programming bench. It is capable of grinding iron, aluminum, brass/bronze or steel part plus fixture up to 70 kg (154 lbs.) with maximum dimensions of 700 mm (27.5 in.) swing by 300 mm (12 in.) high. READY TO GRIND The machine has one rotating electro-spindle with two tools, one attached to each side of the spindle with a laser measurement system, a tailstock, a two position pallet changer and Fanuc controls. ReadyGrindâ¢ has a small footprint allowing it to fit inside a 20 ft. container and it weighs only 6,000 kg (13,227 lbs.), so it can be picked up and moved using a forklift.
