The Stud Welding Process Overview Stud Welding is a versatile, one-step metal fastening system. It is an instantaneous welding process in which a metal fastener is end-joined to a metal surface by creating a high quality fusion weld. There are two types of stud welding processes; Arc and Capacitor Discharge (CD) Stud Welding. Arc Stud Welding is used for large diameter fasteners welded to rougher and/or thicker base metals. Capacitor Discharge (CD) Stud Welding is used for small diameter fasteners welded to thin base metals.
