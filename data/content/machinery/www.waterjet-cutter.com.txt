Specailly useful for waterjet cutting machine, laser cutting machine, plasma cutting machine, CNC router and many other CNC machinery. See details and order information at waterjet gantry table and CNC controller Automatic Abrasive Feeder for continuous waterjet cutting Automatically delivers abrasive from floor level hopper to a mini hopper with a flow control valve on the gantry, and then feeds to the waterjet cutting head. Specially useful for large cutting tables. Requires 100 PSI pneumatic source, Capacity 45 Gal, Self detection of Low/full status of reservoir and start/stop feeding. The hopper has sensor to give warning alarm when abrasive level inside hopper is low. Contact Us for details Full abrasive waterjet cutting system We can also provide full abrasive waterjet cutting system. The full set of waterjet cutter includes high pressure pump, bridge or cantilever CNC cutting table, and CNC controller. Software and hoper is also available. Oil Chiller is optional for closed loop systems. Water jetting cut is cold cutting so that it does not heat up the material being cut and no heat affected zone. Water jet cutter is so versatile that it can cut almost all kinds of materials, metal or non-metal, such as mild steel, stainless steel, marble, granite, glass, ceramic tile, foam, plasmtic, rubber, etc. Waterjet is ideal for small quantity, quick turn around cutting jobs instead of stamping, EDM, plasma, and laser cutting. Most recent development includes 5 axis waterjet, robotic waterjet, CNC waterjet pipe cutting machine, as well as CNC waterjet tire cutting machine.
