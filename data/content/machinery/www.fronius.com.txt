For the past 15 years I have been part of the Technical Support team. I love my job as it allows me to combine my passion for technology with my interest in experiencing new cultures; I spend a lot of time travelling around Asia and Latin America. The job is also extremely varied and no two days are the same. I also appreciate the comprehensive training options that are open to every employee.” Careers at Fronius [if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif] [if IE 9]></video><![endif] START: Numbers Data Facs Image resolution and quality Render all images as progressive JPEGs LG: 1920*440 70% Quality XS: 768*1050 70% Quality [if IE 9]><video style="display: none;"><![endif] [if IE 9]></video><![endif] OUR SITES 8 in Austria 28 Worldwide 14 in Europe END: Numbers Data Facs the Fronius YouTube channel Visit the official Youtube Channel of Fronius.
