Keep control of your process WattPilote combines measurement and processing in a single box. Its installation is very simple as all wiring is done in the electrical cabinet. Thanks to a unique power sensing technology and proprietary algorithms, WattPilote is able to monitor very small tools even when used on large spindles. A PC or a numeric control connected to WattPilote provides an operator display and allows graphical analysis of machining curves, faults, and tool wear.     MCM - Machine Condition Monitoring SafePilote is a 3-axis accelerometer sensor and processor specially designed and built in Digital Way’s lab to provide you with the most effective means for protecting your machines against damage resulting from a crash or a collision. Excessive vibrations during machining are one of the main sources for degrading the quality of your production. This system will help you keep your machine working in good condition. Its very high sensitivity will also give you the ability to detect out-of-balance problems with your high speed tooling. This system will act as a true “black box” that will allow you to track all unexpected events occurring during the use of the machine. Each alarm will be stored in the system’s memory with the corresponding shock and vibration curve.
