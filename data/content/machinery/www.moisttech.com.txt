MoistTech is supported by the original manufacturers of Near-Infrared (NIR) technology in the industrial moisture industry manufacturing a range of on-line sensors & at-line instruments for moisture measurement and real-time moisture process control for numerous applications. Insensitive to material variations such as particle size, material height & color, our moisture sensors provide continuous, reliable readings with zero maintenance. There is a one-time calibration with a non-drift optical design allowing operational personnel to confidently make immediate process adjustments based on real-time measurements. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column The  3000 series  moisture sensors provide: • continuous, reliable readings • insensitive to material variations such as particle size, material height and color. Production efficiency improvements due to accurate real-time measurements provide both energy savings and potential increased productivity with lower material losses. Our moisture detectors use state-of-the-art components allowing installation in the most extreme locations. As a result of MoistTech’s advanced digital processing, only the 3000 series provides true data regardless of gaps and interruptions of product flow on the belt or screw conveyors. In addition to the MoistTech management software, we offer several read-out options to display and / or adjust the measurement outputs. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column Our range of sensors and gauges measure: Oil content  Moisture content Fat content Coat Weight of Coatings Hot Melts Glues Adhesives Printing and more MoistTech has installations in almost every type of application including harsh applications and environments where other gauges could easily break down. The MoistTech sensor currently operates in thousands of applications worldwide and we are confident our technology will help you provide a better-quality product, increased production, and add money to your bottom line. .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row .et_pb_section Featured Moisture Sensor Applications .et_pb_text .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Mineral & Bulk Materials Testing moisture content throughout the manufacturing process provides manufacturers cost savings in energy and fuel costs, as well as having less product waste. With continuous NIR online moisture testing, manufacturers can monitor moisture levels which they in-turn, can precisely control their dryers to optimize the production process with minimum energy requirements.   .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column Human/Snack Foods Manufactures strive to have the best finished product.  The amount of water a product has affects the taste, appearance, consistency, stability as well as the shelf life. Testing the moisture levels of the final product insures manufactures that they have the highest quality product and consistency. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column Animal Foods Monitoring the moisture in the raw materials, controlling the mixing/blending process and moisture of the feed not only ensures the final product with consistent quality, but will enable substantial savings to be achieved in the production process. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column Converting MoistTech’s state-of-the-art sensor is ideally suited to measure the moisture levels as well as water and solvent based coatings and coat weight during the paper/converting process, improving manufactures product quality and increased productivity within substantial cost savings. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column .et_pb_row Wood Products MoistTech offers the most advanced wood moisture sensors for the non-contact measurement of moisture in forest products such as fiber, sawdust, hog fuel, wood flakes, and wood particles allowing wood product manufacturers to adjust moisture levels on real time information lowering raw material and fuel costs, higher yields, and more uniform products. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column Textile/Nonwoven Moisture content varies widely in raw materials, and at different points in the production process, so non-contact moisture measurement is essential for achieving an outstanding final product. By ensuring that textiles are neither too wet nor too dry at key points in the production process, you’ll get a final product with consistent quality as well as a cost savings from reduced waste and downtime. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column BioEnergy What’s worse than a wasted effort? Economical losses and decreased productivity. Excess moisture in products such as hog fuel, waste fiber, wood chips, pellets, saw dust, shavings, and forest waste can ruin products. MoistTech’s on-line and at-line monitoring solutions can provide the most efficient way to measure moisture content. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content .et_pb_blurb More Info... .et_pb_column Tobacco Dryer control is the most sensitive area of the tobacco process. Thousands of kilos per hour are processed where volume, temperature and input moisture vary. The MoistTech model 828 tobacco moisture sensor provides the user with the ability to monitor and control this process to within tenths of a percent. .et_pb_blurb_description .et_pb_blurb_content
