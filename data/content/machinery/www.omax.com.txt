Learn More LEARN ABOUT WATERJET » WHAT IS WATERJET CUTTING? Waterjet machining utilizes a high pressure stream of water to erode a narrow line in the stock material. It has the ability to cut almost any material while maintaining high precision. To cut a wider range of materials from tool steel to titanium to foam, a granular (typically garnet) abrasive is added to the waterjet, increasing the cutting power.
