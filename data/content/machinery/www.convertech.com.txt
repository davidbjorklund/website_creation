Convertech is proud to be a part of the Double E Family. 1" – 2" Differential Shafts Our 1" to 2" Differential Shafts are direct friction style differential shafts. With low tension and easy roll positioning, this shaft can fit cores from 1" to 2" diameters. Continuous Lug Shafts Our Continuous Lug Shaft is our most versatile and economical shaft type. It has multiple bladders to provide excellent grip at any diameter. This shaft also features our GripLock lug design that will not damage cores. Lateral Motion Shafts Our Lateral Motion Shafts are perfect for on-the-fly adjustments while the machine is running. They are the perfect shafts for printing presses, inspection machines, laminating stations, and portable unwinds. Small Diameter Shafts Convertech's mall Diameter Shafts live up to their name. They are among the smallest diameter shafts available. They can be used for narrow and wide web applications and are available in both the leaf and lug styles. Shaft Adapters Convertech's Shaft Adapters are used to create a "system approach" when combined with any shaft or chuck. They are a flexible and inexpensive alternative to multiple sizes of expanding shafts. Leaf Air Shafts The Convertech Leaf Air Shafts are recommended for use with thin walled or narrow cores. They can be used with thin-walled paper, steal, plastic or fiber cores and are less expensive and lighter than our competitors' leaf shafts. Differential Air Shafts With our Differential Air Shaft, you are able to run multiple rolls on a single shaft while maintaining equal tension on all rolls. The internal differential slip allows for running rolls with a wide range of core sizes without any "wobble" or side to side movement. CC-3000 Chuck Adapters Convertech’s CC-3000, formerly known as the Cheap Chuck, is an inexpensive way to adapt a standard air shaft to hold a larger diameter core. These chuck adapters are made with high quality construction and heavy-duty materials.This gives the chuck adapters superior performance in rewind and unwind applications.
