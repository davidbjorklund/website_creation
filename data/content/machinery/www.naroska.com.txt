The core business comprises design, construction, installation and maintenance of manufacturing equipment for food cans, glass and bottle closures and general line components. During its long corporate history going back to the year 1946, Naroska has evolved into a prime supplier to the world's leading can makers and is today recognized as the traditional European press manufacturer with the most diversified portfolio in this industry sector. THE TRADITION OF A STRONG BRAND "Our reputation for personal commitment, quality and efficiency is reflected in the long-standing partnership and friendly cooperation with highly respected companies worldwide. We are grateful for their confidence in us and we look forward to further sharing their passion for our challenging business." Janine Naroska PHILOSOPHY OF INNOVATION "We listen, we think and we deliver solutions â combining over 60 years of expert knowledge with solid design principles â building our machines and tools from ground up with optimized technologies â ensuring highest quality level to make our customers more productive â this is our philosophy." Marcus Naroska VISIONARY THINKING " Everybody is cooking with water , as my friend Rainer said. Yes, we are only human, after all, and this allows the small ones to outperform the big ones. It is the visionary thinking, the staying commitment and meticulous detail work, which finally makes the difference in our business. Rainer's pioneering spirit drives us further to master new challenges with courage and modesty." Jochen Lachnitt OPEN MINDS â OPEN SYSTEMS "Our electrical drives and controls must be highly reliable, state-of-the-art and easily accessible for quick service and individual adaptations - also for our clients' engineers! Therefore we develop and implement our own Naroska standard, designed with well established components from premium sub-suppliers, offering full access to controller and user interface software. In this strategy I see a key factor for customer satisfaction and high productivity at site." Frank Eickmann LOCATIONAL ADVANTAGES "Our region OWL / Bielefeld is one of Germany's strongest economic locations for mechanical engineering and food industry with more than 140.000 companies (i.a. Gildemeister, DÃ¼rkopp Adler, Miele, Dr. Oetker). But it's also a tranquil place, where our solid grown network of over 100 machining specialists allows us to produce at lower costs than in a German metropolitan area. It's here, where we find stability, experience and loyalty â not in a low-wage branch facility abroad. This is also, what our customers find at Naroska â and on top of that: High quality at a reasonable price."
