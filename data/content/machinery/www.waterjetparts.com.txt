All Water-Only Uses Abrasivejet Cutting Uses Advantages of Waterjet Food Cutting Waterjet cutting has changed the way foods are cut and packaged. Many foods, from fruits and vegetables, to meats, pizza and delicate pastries can be elegantly cut using a waterjet. All types of frozen foods are cut with waterjets. Since the waterjet exerts such a small force on the food, it does not crush it; and our waterjet cutting head has pinpoint accuracy (the stream is as thin as a strand of hair), very little is wasted. Wire Stripping Non-abrasive waterjet cutting applications are ideal for wire stripping. The stream is powerful enough to remove any insulation from wires without damaging the wires themselves. It is also much faster and more efficient than using human power to strip wires. Flash Pasteurization High-pressure food pasteurization is a non-thermal process that uses water under very high hydrostatic pressure to preserve packaged food and keep it fresh. Waterjet pumps are used to generate intense pressure that destroys food-borne pathogens without crushing the food or changing its nutritional value. No heat is used in the process, therefore retaining the food’s texture, fresh taste, color and nutrients. Paper Waterjet paper cutting produces no airborne dust, the cut paper does not absorb water, and there are no heat-affected zones to damage the paper. Waterjet cutting is very versatile, water jet machines can cut most anything in the paper products family, such as, tissues, boxes, protective poly coating paper, corrugated cardboard, foam, paper sheets, food service paper, industrial packing paper, excelsior cushioning, bags, Tyvek™, and waxed paper. Glass Cutting Traditionally, glass has been a difficult substance to machine but with the popularity of water jet technology, glass cutting has become relatively simple. From artistic tabletop inlays to detailed stained glass designs, mirrors, glass ornaments, and replacement windows for antique cars, waterjet cutting provides an ideal solution to cutting glass. Stone Cutting Water jet cutting is ideal for the cutting stone and tile in a wide variety of shapes and sizes. Water jet cutting results in a better yield because of smaller kerf (width of the cut) and very little wasted material. This technology has made concrete, granite, marble, sandstone and tile cutting easier and more accessible with fewer restrictions. Wood Cutting Almost all wood can be cut with abrasive waterjet cutting technology. The abrasive particles sand the surface of the wood, leaving a smooth finish that doesn’t require sanding. Printed Circuit Boards Printed Circuit Board Cutting: Waterjet cutting is ideal for circuit boards for several reasons. Waterjet cutting has very tight tolerances and leaves little wasted material. The stream is pinpoint exact, so it can cut very close to parts mounted on the circuit board without damaging them. Finally, waterjet cutting does not produce vibrations the way a saw would, and components are less likely to be damaged. Aerospace/Defense Waterjet cutting is ideal for the aerospace industry due to its ability to preserve the integrity of material and accurately produce complex cuts and irregular shapes. Bulletproof glass, titanium and other products used in the manufacture of armor tanks and other hardware for the military benefit from the exact science of waterjet cutting. Metal Cutting Waterjet cutting renders excellent results in metal cutting, such as carbon steel and alloy. Metal cutting is generally very difficult using conventional machining methods, and may cause an unwanted by-product: heat. Abrasive waterjet cutting, however, does not produce heat that could alter the structure of the metal, and the strength of the metal is retained. Fewer Adjustments Cutting the material doesn't push it, so fixturing is simplified. The waterjet is effective on uneven material and will retain much of its cutting power. Additionally, waterjet cutting does not vibrate or introduce any stresses to the material, so it is less likely to be damaged. Less Waste, More Profit Very little material (0.02" (0.5 mm)) is removed by the waterjet stream during cutting, resulting in less waste. This is a significant benefit when working with expensive material (such as titanium) or hazardous material (such as lead). When machining or roughing out expensive materials such as titanium, your scrap still has value- you get chunks, not chips. Heat Free Process Waterjet cutting is a cold process and results in no heat damage to materials. This is an important benefit. No "heat-affected zone" (HAZ) means cutting can be done without changing the basic structure of the material. Safety There are no noxious fumes as a result of vaporized metals and no risk of fires. Waterjets also eliminate airborne dust particles, smoke, and other contaminants when cutting materials such as asbestos and fiberglass. This greatly improves the work environment and reduces problems arising from operator exposure. Clean and Efficient Waterjet cutting produces no hazardous waste, reducing waste disposal costs. Waterjets use very little water (a half gallon to approximately one gallon per minute depending on waterjet cutting head orifice size), and the water that is used can be recycled using a closed-looped system. Wastewater usually is clean enough to filter and dispose of down a drain. Precise Cutting Tolerances Waterjet cutting does not leave a burr or a rough edge, and eliminates other machining operations such as finish sanding and grinding. H20 waterjets offer excellent tolerances and it is common to machine up to 4" thickness on even the hardest substances.
