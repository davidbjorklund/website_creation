I came to Kumler’s in 1973 and we had a new Devilbiss booth and were a company of 4 people. The equipment served us well through the years as we grew, purchasing Team Blowtherm downdrafts. Now we are a company of 35 great people using, in my opinion, the best equipment and booths we have ever had in our new Garmat 31 foot downdrafts. Our paint department productivity is the best it has ever been. I think our paint quality can’t and doesn’t need to get better, and then it does.
